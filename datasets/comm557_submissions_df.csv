The thing that I'm wondering is, in the new year when I start my ADHD medication, is there a way I can have a 'second chance' at further education? Without getting into an obscene amount of debt. Could I potentially re take my a levels? Do an access course and then go onto to further my career, get a degree, do all those things I feel I was robbed of over a decade ago?

I am wondering if others have had a similar experience to me...

I have been prescribed Adderral for almost 2 years now. Lifelong depression and anxiety dx.

I take 30-40mg Adderall a day (40 if a busy admin day). I don't really want to be taking a higher dose but I have noticed the last few weeks that the ADHD meds aren't really working as well and thought maybe the Pristiq could be suppressing its effects?

I‚Äôve been noticing the past couple years that I will change my life/opinions based on something I‚Äôm obsessed with at that moment.

Generalizing some other examples, but I‚Äôve found that whatever my obsession is at one moment will kind of dictate my decisions. These decisions include what hobbies I want to take up, to where I want to live.

Typically my obsession is media-related: a celebrity, a TV show, etc. which is completely unrealistic to base decisions off of, but I don‚Äôt know how to stop letting it influence me.

this is really effective as it sustains their attention and I‚Äôm essentially doing the parts they struggle with which is breaking down the question into something manageable.

but one of my students just flat out ignores the questions I ask. it‚Äôs like he has some earplugs in and he just repeats some answer to what he thinks I asked until I give up in exhaustion. 

I‚Äôll tell him exactly how to read a letter, but since he didn‚Äôt bother listening at all, he‚Äôll continue to repeatedly read it the way he did, even while I‚Äôm explaining.

I try asking if this is difficult, or why he still read it a certain way, so at the very least I can try a different approach.

However, despite the many positive changes in my life, I seem to have episodes of binge drinking once or twice a week still. It throws off my progress in health and controlling my binge eating disorder.

It occurs on the weekends. It‚Äôs like as soon as it‚Äôs Friday/Saturday/Sunday my brain flicks a switch, like all of a sudden it‚Äôs ok to have 15 beers just because of the time of week it is. It can be dangerous, too‚Ä¶ on Saturday night I was wasted and stood on the edge of my balcony 9 stories up, hanging off the edge. If I lost my grip I would be dead.

Generally, I try to not be 'limited', pigeon-holed, hide behind or be painted by negative traits of ADHD. However one thing that frustrates me is finding it very difficult to just sit down and read books.  I have so many books I'm excited about reading and continue to buy more, but getting through even one seems to require very rare circumstances. Generally if I stop to read, I either get sidetracked, impatient, or get tired after sometimes a page or 2.

Just wondering if any others have experienced this and been able to overcome it, and if you have any techniques or approaches you've found would help? I've wondered about even setting up an area in the house dedicated to reading? Or maybe going out somewhere to read (library, beach, park?) Or allocating a certain time of day? I do find that I can listen to audio books more easily than reading, however that's usually at night and I usually fall asleep during it, and find it kind of annoying having to work out where I got up to. 

The same goes for drawing/art/music practice for that matter! But one thing at a time :D

I also love nice salads, but my ADHD fatigues me eating it - you have to cut so much, and pick it up so many times on your fork and then chew so much and every mouthful tastes different. It makes eating feel like a task, and then I never end up finishing it and then I end up snacking because I‚Äôm hungry because I didn‚Äôt finish. 

Is there something healthy you can eat in a few bites - maybe something protein rich but low carb, that tastes nice ? That you can hold and bite like a sandwich??

After starting a new sport, eating healthier, going out and meeting people more, I still have issues with depression, attention, short term memory, initiating projects, and a bunch of other things that are basically an ADHD diagnosis list.

I've been talking with my doctor and therapists to get on a treatment plan of CBT and medication. Adderall has really helped me in the past, but I stopped because it gave me bad anxiety sometimes, and it felt like its usefulness dropped off fast. I'm hoping to figure out a long-term treatment plan with my doctor, but I'm curious to hear from other people what their journeys have looked like, so I can get an idea of my own if I end up getting formally diagnosed (I have a qb test coming up, but my doctor has already identified that ADHD is likely).

Did you have to switch between medications a lot? Are you having side effects from taking a stimulant long-term?  Did medication or CBT and lifestyle changes help you more? Did treating your ADHD abate your depression or other comorbidities like OCD, or make them more pronounced?

And generally I am able to manage my clients and my business fairly well. My inattentive ADD creeps in here and there, but I have generally been able to manage myself and find a solution to problems when they arise.

But I have a client who has been making my life a living hell. Late paying invoices, demanding redesigns after approvals, requiring finished product be shipped to locations in Europe with just a few days notice. The big problem has been not paying bills. After 3 months of broken promises, I had to lay the smack down a couple of weeks ago.

My vendor has been looking at me like I'm an amateur, a fuck-up who can't manage his own business. The thing is, I've also had a lot of serious personal stuff going on. One of my dogs died about 5 months ago, and now my other dog is deathly sick, and probably won't be with me much longer. In the middle of all this, my van that I use extensively for my business had to go into the shop for some very expensive repairs.  and to make it even more exciting, I'm involved in a lawsuit against my former biz partner who I had to sue because I caught her trying to steal the business. 

So tonight I sat down and wrote my vendor an email explaining my situation, and my problems with ADD. They're not a typical vendor, we have a closer, more friendly kind of relationship. But still, I have never let my ADD even breach any conversation in my professional relationships.

75,178sw32,t3_178sw32,neosmama,My latest appointment experience,"A couple weeks ago, I decided to go to the psychiatrist on my college campus. For context, I was looking into getting academic accommodations and possibly exploring medication options. I was diagnosed about 2 years ago, but the psychiatrist who diagnosed me never gave me paperwork stating my diagnosis (I need paperwork to get accommodations, but it was marked in my chart). 

When I was diagnosed- I felt so much clarity. I started understanding myself better and learning how to navigate better in life. 

Long story short- during my recent appointment, the doctor asked me about my symptoms and I described some to her. She asked if I‚Äôm failing my classes- which I‚Äôm not. At the end of our session, she said that I don‚Äôt meet the threshold for ADHD. Lately, I have been struggling with focusing in class and doing daily tasks especially around my home. Her saying that I don‚Äôt meet the threshold felt so invalidating. It makes me feel like there must just be something wrong with me since I can‚Äôt focus or keep my home clean. 

I asked her if I could give more examples of my symptoms and she declined. I also asked if we could reference the DSM to better understand why I didn‚Äôt meet the threshold, to which she also declined. She also said that her opinion may be different from other doctors (basically that the other doctors are wrong). 

I have also been diagnosed with anxiety which she had no problem confirming (without even evaluating me for). I don‚Äôt know why she would take another doctors diagnosis for my anxiety but not ADHD. 

I left the meeting in tears. Now I‚Äôm beginning to wonder if I never even had ADHD and if I just have other unresolved problems. But I also know what I‚Äôve been experiencing and I‚Äôve been diagnosed. I just don‚Äôt know what to do or trust anymore.

I have never been diagnosed but watching the videos was quite unsettling as I relate to a lot of the things she talks about in her videos,

Specifically the wall of awful, my inability to make change or surpass negative emotions even though I logically know I should be able to.

I used to work in a job I didn't like, that didn't pay me enough and so all I really did was stay at home and do nothing on my days off, and goto work and drink afterwards on weekends.

One of my coworkers was amazing and I always loved and looked forward to working with her, and she was upset when I said I was leaving.

Now I've left and been in a new job for a while I've been going to visit a couple of times but the other day it really hit me how much I miss her, and I always thought I wasn't attracted to her or any of the other girls I used to work with as I never met anyone else. 

But I'm now getting worried because I think I actually am attracted to her, and everytime this happens/has previously happened I end up ruining it because I block the person out to avoid rejection but that ends in losing a friendship, or force myself to tell them when drunk so that they will reject me and I can go back to comfortably not liking anyone.

Its easy for me or anyone to say I should just tell her how I feel, but I can't see any positives and my brain keeps shutting off now when I think about doing it, I can't see how it won't break me if I tell her. I would appreciate any advice, because all my friends in the past when I've liked other girls have just said go for it and ask, and I just can't do it.

Logically I know that if I get rejected it won't mean the end of our friendship and if I don't ask and she would have said yes I'm going to miss out on something potentially amazing.

Here are a list of things I've been doing for over 3 months:

No porn  
  
gym 5 days a week  
  
Skincare routine  
  
less than 1 hour of social media a day (zero social media on phone, just on computer to catch up with people)  
  
morning walk 20-30 minuets  
  
i get 7-8 hours of sleep no matter what and i go to bed and wake up at the exact same time every day  
  
right now im working on developing other habits like meditation and journaling but have only been doing it for a few days.

I don't usually take meds on the weekend but I did yesterday and today. Here's what I got done:

1.Dug up all the outdoor plants that I'm wintering over indoors and potted them. 

2. Cut back all my hanging baskets and brought those indoors.

3. Completed a bunch of insurance and tax documentation.  

4. Got 40 items photographed, edited and listed on eBay. This took a total of 8 hours. It's a lot of work but it's how I earn my living. 

5. Photographed and edited more inventory to list tomorrow.  (Another 4 hours.)

6. Unloaded and reloaded my dishwasher. 

7. Washed my hair. 

8. Made food in crockpot for the week. 

9. Wrote a letter to an elderly friend who is in a nursing home. 

10. Packaged and shipped 14 items. 

11. Chopped 7 onions in my food processor and froze them so they don't go bad. Same thing with potatoes.

I was diagnosed with adhd about a year ago, 45f, been trying to find meds that will work for me since.

My doctor put me on Vyvanse, 30mg this week. So far I like it for adhd, the instant release adderal was making me very anxious and giving me heart palpitations that would trigger panic attacks. So far the Vyvanse has been more ‚Äústeady‚Äù.

Unfortunately, I have started to experience some upper abdominal pain which has been ramping up, I have always had a pretty sensitive stomach and since having my gall bladder removed a few years ago it has been worse. Usually,  it is minor and Pepcid ac does the trick, but since starting the Vyvanse it has been worse and Pepcid isn‚Äôt putting a dent in it.

I would like to see if I can try and fix this so I can give vyvanse a real chance.

I take it in the morning with Greek yogurt or oatmeal. I think my lack of appetite the first couple days is maybe what triggered my stomach so I have been trying to force myself to eat something every couple hours and obviously tons of water.  I switched from carbonated to normal water when my stomach started to act up.

So just looking for any suggestions if anyone has experienced something similar.

The reason I didn't get it earlier was because most teachers gave additional time if needed either way so it wasn't necessary.

But what should I do for uni? Should I learn to get by without accommodation? Will going without it make me a stronger student and better test taker? I'm scared that if I do register, I won't be ready for 'the real world' after I graduate or I won't be ready to continue my academic career. On the other hand, I don't want my performance to suffer (tangibly and on paper) then impact my ability to get into the school I want to attend to continue my higher education/career.

Thereafter, I exchanged to Ritalin LA 30mg, which was splendid on the exact three days. It was simply amazing. It worked 6 hours. Doing anything was as easy as holding up a grain of sand. But on the fourth day, it simply began not working anymore. I tried a few days on, but nothing. Nada. Then I exchanged to Ritalin 40mg, which, coincidently, on the first three days made the same great effects as the previous, and on the fourth day stopped working likewise.

I decided to go right to Vyvanse, because I don't have much money, and I thought because of my experience, methylphenidate wasn't for me. I began with 30mg (reincapsulated), and I only felt mildly calmer on the first two days, but with no improvement in focus and attention. From the 3rd day on, I felt nothing. I have since upped the dosage to 50mg (through titration in water) and taken the intact 70mg capsule, but nothing. It just increases my anxiety and causes other normal adverse effects.

I just need people telling me that this isn't normal, or adhd is responsible, and in no way you can use handicap as an excuse for Smashing stuff. My brother keeps excusing his kids behavior with ""he's adhd, not his fault!"", ""the other one can't do anything wrong either, ""he's autistic!"". Maybe if enough people answers, I'll show it to him idk.

For a bit of clarification here's a list of what the kid did :
-Make holes in walls by punching or using objet to make holes.
-destroy (a) playstation controller(s?)
-almost destroyed his playstation
-throwing a mug against the wall
-bunch of other stuff such as throwing toys as a toddler, spitting on the ground (as a middle schooler), being rudes insulting, calling his mother a fat bitch, calling his dad names, being mean to other people in general by making fun of them.
-punch a glass door and break it (apparently it was fragile but still. Kid was bare hands and did that because he was pissed.

This kid as zero self control and he is medicated, but as soon as the meds wears off he becomes out if control again, he smashes stuff and laugh like a maniac.

(1) Timelines
I think I have adhd, and have thought so for a long time but tried to just get onwith it. It isn't working and  was wondering if anyone knows the timescales around getting diagnosed? I currently live in Wales, but my Dr is in England as I used to live there, not sure if that will impact timings.

Iay be able to go private, but I have heard then you would need to fund all meds etc yourself going forward, and that would be quite a financial drain, so ideally would go a route that I could avoid paying for abd meds (if needed) indefinitely (I don't mind paying initially if needed).

(2) Should I disclose I am trying to get assessed for ADHD or not)

I am also having some issues in work, and have failed to meet standards for a professional improvement plan that was put in place. The issues are mostly around attention to smaller details and turn around times on my work. My high level knowledge, client interactions, team interactions and general understanding and advice in my field are all good, but my managers are just concerned that I can't get the ""simple"" things right. 

For me the simple things just kill me, and I have a knot in my stomach now that I will have misspelled something, or have used the wrong font etc in every piece of work I do. I also take longer to do tasks, I just struggle sometimes to get started, or when I do I and I get an email or teams my focus is gone for a half hour. 

I have a meeting coming up in work in the next few weeks, likely will be issued with a final warning, or if I am lucky, put on an extended personal improvement plan. 

My question is, should I disclose that I have done some research and online tests and believe that I I have ADHD (the inattentive type) and I believe that is why I am struggling with these seemingly simple areas of my job.

I expect that as I haven't a formal assessment (I should have dealt with this long ago, but will push on with the process this time) it will have little bearing, but I just really like my job and want  to try see if we can do another personal improvement plan and try again. I am also worried that it may also be detrimental mentioning it.

So far I have no complaints it‚Äôs seemed to clear up a lot of issues I had. Anyways now to the questions:

1.This might be NSFW so just a forewarning. I avoid porn at all cost and recently have been trial and erroring masturbation alone. I took my meds this morning at around 8 was feeling good. Decided ‚Äúto‚Äù and now I‚Äôm feeling really depleted almost like a depression feeling but I would say the best term is ‚Äúempty‚Äù(no pun intended). Did I screw my dopamine up? Did I make a mistake by doing that? Honestly I was just bored. 

2.Question number 1 leads me into my second question and is that is it still acceptable for me to have an energy drink or caffeine in general in the afternoon? I feel like that would re spark my flame a little bit. 

3.How will I know if and when to raise my medication dose? Of course I‚Äôm on 20mg starting and I feel like it‚Äôs made a dramatic difference and yes I know medication isn‚Äôt the cure to ADHD but I feel like I‚Äôm still craving dopamine inducing things.

Honestly I'm not sure exactly what category this fits under. I just stumbled on the idea of post-traumatic ADHD and, because I really haven't seen many people talk about it, was wondering if anyone has been treated for this or has any more legitimate information on it.

The idea is that trauma affects brain development, stunting growth in areas that are associated with ADHD, thus creating an ADHD brain, if you will. I'm sure this is hard to distinguish from mild/""high functioning"" ADHD being exacerbated by trauma, which I suspect is what happened in my case, but I do find the idea intriguing since much of my trauma started in mid childhood and I didn't have many of the typical ADHD symptoms at a very young age.

I hope it doesn't come off as though l'm trying to equate PTSD with ADHD or suggest ADHD is an emotional issue rather than a neurological one.

125,178my60,t3_178my60,jake__pie,Adderall reducing sense of smell...??,"Hey all,

So over the years I've been on a few different ADHD meds including ritalin and adderall (both IR and XR). Most recently I've been taking adderall 20 mg XR and I feel like I've had some of the less common side effects.

I feel crazy because I don't think I've heard someone talk about reduced sense of smell as a side effect on adderall but... has anyone else experienced this or is this just me?? 

I don't mean a loss of ability to smell, I mean more like a dulled sense of smell.

Before anyone asks, no I'm not nasally congested or sick lol I'm breathing perfectly fine. 

Like I can still smell things, and I haven't LOST my sense of smell, but I have noticed I'm less sensitive and less aware of different smells everywhere I go. When I walk into a room or go outside and I'm on adderall, I don't notice what it smells like unless I really try to take a deep breath and smell it. For example, last weekend I was at a restaurant and my friend said it really smells like smoke in here, and I had no idea. I have to actively try to smell the air in the room before I notice if it smells odd. 

I stopped taking adderall like 2 weeks ago this week I've noticed the biggest difference in how everything smells. I walk outside and immediately the first thing I now notice is how good everything smells. I haven't changed anything in my diet or medications recently except for adderall when I decided to take a break from it. Even when I'm walking around the house nowadays, I go from room to room and the smell from room difusers in the kitchen vs. living room smells way more potent now even though I haven't changed any of them in weeks. 

It feels very similar to how emotional numbing is another side effect of adderall (which I have also experienced, it's like my emotions get switched off and I feel robotic when on adderall) but this is more like a numbed sense of smell... if that makes any sense...

I was told to take one in the morning, see how things go, take a second if needed in afternoon. I tried both ways - each resulted in the same problem in that about 3 hours after the last dose, I end up getting a massive headache with eyes feeling like I have been up all night, and a feeling of fatigue. Told doc about this; she prescribed 10 mg Adderall XR, on the assumption that it would smooth things out, but it hasn't yet arrived. 

Yesterday I attempted to break the 10mg up into 5mg parts, taking one every 3 hours or so to see what happened. Same problem as above occurred by evening. At that point I took an additional 5 mg (thus making it 25 mg total for day) which didn't seem to help much - by bedtime, same headache/eye/fatigue problems as above, with only noticeable difference being a slightly higher heart rate.

Anyone run into this kind of issue and end up resolving it? If so, how - did you end up switching off of Adderall to something else entirely? Thanks!

While I know we all struggle with attention day-to-day and masking takes energy, what is the quantifiable impact you have noticed of ADHD on your professional life?

Doing my PhD nearly killed me, and I now understand that that is because I had untreated ADHD. However, I still managed to finish the PhD and got a handful of papers out of it, so in that sense my ADHD didn't impact my ability to get a PhD. Perhaps I could have gotten more out of the PhD without ADHD or had I been medicated, but I don't know that for sure.

But on the other hand I know I have missed out on some opportunities due to having untreated ADHD. I have found myself pushing it too tight with deadlines, and then I haven't been able to apply for a grant, or a jobs because I left it too late, noticed deadline was going to be in a few days but I hadn't even engaged with other stakeholders so I couldn't possibly go for it now. So that would be a very tangible, quantifiable impact.

And the reason I ask is because I am applying for a promotion and I am disclosing my ADHD, but I have been told that unless I explain the exact impact, it won't be considered by the panel. Now, I am trying to understand what the impact has been. I know it has impacted me, but I am thinking maybe by learning from others I'll be able to better identify the exact ways in which it has impacted me (aside from the above).

140,178lpob,t3_178lpob,abcd_trapshit,The reason why it‚Äôs hard for ADHDers to have friends outside of work and their relationships,"I believe I have figured it out after countless attempts to make friends and ‚Äúgood trial friendships‚Äù, and all of it being gone after a while.

In friendships there is no other reason to hang out together than being psychologically compatible. 
Our little mistakes, hyperfixations, weird behavior patterns freak non-ADHD people out. We are treated as losers and weirdos. Our weirdness is much less tolerable in friendships than 1) at work where we are ‚Äúforced‚Äù to treat everyone good, or 2) in long-term romantic relationships where tolerating each other is considered morally correct and important.

IMO, that‚Äôs why we ADHDers are hyperfocused on romantic relationships (to compensate the lack of friendships; and this is why we are clingy and obsessive) and are desperate at being nice and friendly at work or in places of interest (since it is the only place where people can't escape us).

Interestingly, with ADHD-people it is hard too, even though we are compatible. We just laugh at our mistakes and feel comfortable, but we are unlikely to find any energy to meet each other or chat often, so such friendships also do not last long.

Consequently, IMO, it is SUPER important to have a social hobby and job because it‚Äôs only way for us to socialize regularly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/178lpob/the_reason_why_its_hard_for_adhders_to_have/,True,2023-10-15 18:31:47,False,13,False,False,80,0.89,/r/ADHD/comments/178lpob/the_reason_why_its_hard_for_adhders_to_have/

Ok so not that long ago I experienced one of my longest ""Freezes"". Basically what happened was during school we had 6 tests in total that week, it was the last test of the week, a German word test. When I noticed more than half the words on the paper were something I never even knew we were supposed to learn, I got angry and extremely sad. The teacher got angry too and afterwards, I just completely shut down. I wasn't moving, not even a twitch I was just looking at random things and breathing... and that is all that I remember from this period. 40 mins later, I wake up from this ""freeze"" right as my classmates were packing up to go to a different class... I managed to follow them but for the entire lesson I felt as if I was recovering for anesthetic... slow moving, barely conscious, making simple movements with my fingers to stay conscious. I got better after the next lesson but only enough to pay attention and move slowly. I recovered from that a few hours later.

And to make this clear I was ""Awake"" the entire time, but the only thing I can remember is looking at random spots and breathing. Nothing else.

  
To make this clear this isn't my first freeze, but it is my longest one. I never felt as if I was recovering from anesthetic before... I'm barely keeping up anymore and I don't know if I'm gonna make it till my psych appointment on the 20th...

Anyway, I took my first generic today, same dose as always, after over two years on vyvanse, and I feel incredibly jittery and hot and uncomfortable and my heart rate is a little higher than normal.

In terms of possible other factors: nothing regarding my overall health has changed recently except that due to injury, I went from doing high intensity weightlifting workouts 3-5 times a week to only the physical activity I get during the day from my job as a teacher, which I know contributes to feeling anxious so maybe it‚Äôs just that?

I have noticed the last few weeks that on days where I've allowed myself to get sucked into study problems without breaks I've started showing ADD symptoms within the active time window of the Concerta. I'll start shaking my leg again, craving snacks/soda, and can notice as my ability to focus, take in new info, and reason through the problems drops pretty quickly. 

&#x200B;

I'm not sure why I'd be worse off on a higher dose when the middle does was working well most of the time. Is it possible that I'm allowing myself to get so burnt out in the day that I'm decreasing my ability to think and focus despite the medication being in effect? Am I just exhausting myself?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Long story short I suspect I have some form of ADHD for a while (insane procrastination and a myriad of other symptoms). I went to a psychiatrist and she gave me Concerta after a one hour chat.

&#x200B;

I'm kinda scared at how easy it was to get a prescription. I researched the drug and 4 days later, today, finally started on 18mg.

&#x200B;

I don't know what's normal or not on this drug. I'm a extreme coffee drinker, and the best I can explain my current physical state is ""wow it feels like the coffee finally worked"" (coffee can put me to sleep usually, literally). 

Nothing extreme, I just feel like I'm on a really good day productivity wise. It happens from time to time for me, can last a month then disappears. Example: I worked extra hard on a project for 3 months, then procrastinated for 6, f\*\*\*\* annoying. Right now I feel like I'm on the good phase, so while I feel a bit hyper, it's not an unknown feeling.

&#x200B;

My anxiety is also completely gone, she said it might be linked to ADHD (?) but would have to wait before we know for sure. I'm hypochondriac and was in a bad crisis, and now it's gone. 

&#x200B;

Well it's still here but I don't care anymore and feel like I can reason about it and push it away, kinda like a good meditation session (""I acknowledge you and decide not to engage). I also feel super clear headed, and cleared up tasks with almost what could be considered motivation today, like I mentioned above.

&#x200B;

My first medication was Ritalin, and I took it for 2 years before switching to Vyvanse. I didn't like Ritalin because my days were not constant at all. After 4 hours (crash), I would get very tired, hungry and have no motivation to do anything. The main issue was my small appetite, I was never hungry and couldn't eat anything. I went from 110 lbs to 93 lbs (I'm 5'3), so I talked to my doctor to change my medication and he prescribed me Vyvanse. Even though I still have the same problem with my appetite, I decided at the time to keep taking this medication since all of my other symptoms went away, as the medication lasts up to 14h and only had one medication crash at the end of the day.

 It is now 2 years later since my first dose of Vyvanse and I still have so much trouble with food. It's like I'm disgusted by it and some textures make me gag, and I know it's not an eating disorder since it only does that while on meds. My weight is always fluctuating between 90-95 lbs and I don't know what to do anymore, I just want to be healthy. 

I read that there was non-stimulant medications for ADHD such as Strattera (Atomoxetine), but I don't know how much it affects appetite. What is also bothering me is the fact that I can be so productive and still be myself on Vyvanse compared to Ritalin that literally made me a zombie.

Then came the regret, I should‚Äôve thought longer about getting the tattoo, it looked out of place on my arm and I should‚Äôve listened but I was so set out to get it done and never thought twice and the consequences. I knew I was in trouble‚Ä¶

People who have seen the tattoo compliment me and I get positive attention from it. I still suffered for days with regret to the point that it was affecting my personal life. I wanted my clear skin back! 

Guess I didn‚Äôt adapt well to the change in my appearance and change can make me anxious and insecure. 

Today, I now know that it‚Äôs now a part of me and that I‚Äôm now accepting it more positively and admiring it myself. 

I‚Äôve learnt one thing about myself. Sometimes my impulsiveness can affect my ability to plan ahead and not consider the potential risks and consequences which could result in me getting into danger. Something my ADHD does to me.

182,178gfy8,t3_178gfy8,Teh_Jammy_Boi,Me and my impulsiveness lead me into getting a tattoo (Part 2),"(Continuation of my story) 

Moving on to this year, I knew I wanted another tattoo and wanted to go bigger and better! So anyways, I looked into designs that I thought would be nice on my body. I eventually caught my attention with a clock and rose design, loved the detail and the meaning behind it. To me the design tells personally ‚ÄúTime is precious, spend it with loved ones‚Äù and I loved the idea of it fading as the tattoo aged with time until my dying breath. I talked about it with my girlfriend too and she loved the idea as well.

I booked an appointment for it to get done, I originally thought about getting it placed onto my lower left arm. All is well!

Then the day came for me to get the tattoo I had set my heart on. I told my mother I was going to the tattoo shop to get inked. She tried to talk me out of it but I was too excited and I didn‚Äôt listen the only piece of advice that I took from her was to reconsider the placement and place it onto my upper right arm and get it small.

I arrived feeling confident and good that I was getting a professionally done tattoo, I worked with my artist and took his advice of having it done pretty big to bring out the detail better rather than having it small. So I go with that and 6 hours later my piece is done! Was liked what I saw at first. Great! I‚Äôve done well!

I‚Äôm here to share a story about how I got a tattoo out of impulsiveness and thought it was a good idea but then felt terrible afterwards because of my actions. (This story is broken into parts so that I follow the rules of this Reddit page.)

I‚Äôm a guy who likes tattoos, I think they look good on different people and how they can express a person‚Äôs personality from body art and can tell a story. (I only like it if the tattoos are well done and not crude or ugly)

I grew up with parents who were strongly against tattoos because they‚Äôre unprofessional and make a person look bad. I get that point of view, I do, but as an individual, it‚Äôs up to you what you want to do to your body. I still live with my parents while I‚Äôm saving up money to buy a place with my girlfriend.

I see tattoos all the time where I live and was pretty much the norm amongst people in social settings. I remember getting my first tattoo at age 20 while I was still in education and felt good about having one. (My first tattoo is a Legend Of Zelda triforce symbol that is located on my upper left arm as a symbol of my gamer side. That tattoo was easily concealed by regular clothing and I pretty much forget that one existed, to be honest.)

186,178flry,t3_178flry,throw_away_x_x_x_x,42 Years Old and only now being tested. (UK),"Hi folks,

I'm new to this subreddit, so forgive me if I've missed anything glaringly obvious from this post.

As the title says, I am 42 years old and I am only now being out forward for ADHD testing on the NHS, after around 25 years of various treatments for Depression and Anxiety (which have worked to a certain extent).

When I was initially referred to Psychiatry by my GP I was sceptical when he diagnosed A-Typical Depression and Anxiety only, but when I questioned this on multiple occasions I was given the whole ""you're the patient and I'm the Psychiatrist, who do you think knows better?"" response. Thankfully this guy retired and after ablong wait I was reassigned to a new Psychiatrist who, before she had even spoken to me, had written ""ADHD/BPD??"" on her notes.

Anyway, she got me to complete the initial screening forms and based on this she believes there is a strong case for having me fully assessed for ADHD. 

Basically, I go through severe moodswings on a regular basis, I am very easily distracted, I find it hard to start a job and if things go slightly badly I am prone to either quitting completely or finishing it badly just to get it over with. I also have a really bad habit of putting things down and forgetting what I've done with them, often with minutes, if not seconds.

I am aware that all of the above do not justify an ADHD diagnosis alone, but I didn't want to go in to full details of every little thing.

What I am curious about is, has anyone else been in the same position where, for years, their GP, Psychiatrist or other doctor has essentially denied that a problem exists, only to get a second opinion strongly backing up your suspicions?

If so, how have things been since getting the diagnosis and treatments?

If you need me to add anything, please let me know.

198,178efxq,t3_178efxq,confusedagain88,Partner and extreme noise intolerance- how can I help him?,"Hi all,

My partner of 6 months is suffering from an extreme intolerance to noise. He was diagnosed with ADHD only 4 years ago, when he was in his late 40s. 

He can not tolerate specific sounds such as :

(1) The sound of a dog barking.
(2) Loud music making its way into his room  (from even far distances). He is otherwise  comfortable listening to music with ear pods. White music works well for him, too. 
(3) People talking loudly
(4) Smacking and chewing sounds.

Things are getting out of control because he keeps moving from one house to another, trying to escape external, unwanted sounds. 

 It's puzzling because the sounds aren't that loud. Most times, the sounds travel from far away but he is extremely sensitive to even the slightest of sounds. 

It's becoming very destabilising, and he is almost constantly on the edge. 

The upmarket neighbourhoods are very peaceful but also too costly for his budget. Money is tight for him. He is considering fleeing the country to another one, which has the same noise issues. 

I'm at a loss and don't really know what to do. He complains constantly, and I empathise with him, truly. 

Is this typical ADHD behaviour ? Or something else? 

I am looking for ideas on how to help him deal with his noise aversion and get him settled.

Anyway, I have been suspecting that I have ADHD for a long time now because I looked up the symptoms and they match a lot with what I do. Even my friends have told me that they think I have ADHD. A few weeks ago I told my parents about this and asked them if they could take me to a psychologist or a psychiatrist, their answer was ""No"".   


They said that only crazy people go to psychologists and psychiatrists, I am normal and I dont need to go to get diagnosis. I haven't told them about this but I have struggled with anxiety for a long time as well but in their eyes I am completely healthy and normal.  


I contested and said that just take me there once, they ended making a huge deal out of it and told me that the reason why I feel this way is because I don't pray enough and that if I started praying again I will go back to normal.  


I am an atheist btw but they will probably kill me if I told em about that but that's a conversation for another time. For now I wanna know how do I go to a psychiatrist?? I cant go to one cause I have to be 18 to be able to go to one alone, I just turned 17 which means I have to wait a whole year to be able to go alone but I dont wanna do that because it's so hard to focus on my studies now, and I dont wanna do any worse in school.

Do you have a plan for the really hard times?,"Executive dysfunction sucks :( but I've found ways to create structure and routine which helps so I function ""well enough"". It's not perfect but I get by, and I try to be kind to myself and recognise my limitations.

Where I struggle though is when something really tough happens that causes my executive functioning to nosedive. These things aren't frequent, but would usually occur for more than a week - like bad illness, major work stress, significant interpersonal conflict, other mental health stressors, etc. My brain is overwhelmed and struggles to cope with much outside of those things. I recognise my limits and do what I am capable of doing and what will help my recovery. For example I'll put off anything difficult or not time sensitive and prioritise rest.

I'm just wondering if there are things you do when it's really hard to help yourself get by and recover, until you've got more capacity to ease back into things? Do you plan for these times? 

A few things from me - take a day off work when I see burnout looming, pre-stock the freezer with frozen food so I have easy meals, ask my partner to help with urgent admin tasks, get a cleaner (if I can afford it), find time to just do nothing (often with a comfy blanket and emergency chocolate), ask my neighbour for help with something at home (I'm fortunate we have a good relationship and help each other out with stuff).

238,1786w8b,t3_1786w8b,k3irxn,Help for ADHD Medication Side Effects?,"Hey all! 

This is my first time posting here so bear with me haha. I've been on meds to treat my ADHD for about 2 years now (Dexamphetamine), and my current dosage is 1 5mg tablet three times daily, as needed. At first it was 2 in the morning, 2 in the afternoon. Honestly I don't really stick to either because 3-4 is usually too much for me, so I take 2 usually, or at the most 3. If I feel I need to concentrate a little, I'll just take one. 

The meds work great in terms of helping me stay on task and regulate my focus. It's literally a life-changing difference, and has helped me so much with my work and university. However the reason why I don't take them more and I'm hesistant to take them more is because of the side effects. 

Usually when I take them, I get a complete loss of appetite, a really gross scratchy/dry throat (I have bad sensory issues so this is really bad for me), a migraine due to eating less, and less sleep. The sleep in particular is bad because I already have insomnia, but my meds keep me up for 2-3 extra hours. I'm also trying to bulk up a bit more, so the appetite loss is pretty bad since I don't want to lose weight, but when I take my meds I only have 1-2 meals a day. It's not like I'm not hungry, I just literally cannot physically eat more. 

I've done things like take my meds after my first meal and try to eat more food in the morning before taking them, and having shakes or 'liquid calories' throughout the day. I got tablets for the headaches I get if I take them for multiple days in a row. But I'm not sure what to do about the lack of sleep (melatonin doesn't work on me too well) and the dry throat. 

Any advice/tips? Particularly about the appetite and dry throat? I really want to be able to take my meds more but at this point I'm avoiding them because the side effects annoy me so much. I talked to my doctor about maybe switching brands but he said since I'd still be taking stimulants the side effects are the same.

Even my therapist noticed a difference just from half a session. 
Talked to my doctor and she said she would mark the script as brand only from now on and agreed on a dosage increase. 

Edit: 10mg increase to 40mg

260,1783bnn,t3_1783bnn,ThereAreStars,Processing and ADHD,"So I know I have issues with processing but today I realized some of the ways it presents/affects me. 

One way is that if someone is talking to me, I might miss parts of what they‚Äôre saying.

Ex:

Can you put the clothes into the washing machine?

I hear: 

Can you put the into washing? 

Sometimes I can figure out what they‚Äôre saying from context. For instance, if they‚Äôre handing me a basket of clothes and I hear ‚Äúput‚Äù and ‚Äúwashing‚Äù I can figure it out. 

Other times I‚Äôll hear everything they‚Äôre saying but I won‚Äôt understand all of it. Or, I won‚Äôt remember parts of what they said. 

Now I realize why I struggled with instructions in school.

 I can do instructions like: Can you do: A, B, and then C? Ex: can you walk into the office, ask the secretary for the papers, and then bring them back to me? 

Especially if I know what type of papers they want, why they‚Äôre asking for them, etc. I understand what they‚Äôre saying and it‚Äôs not a lot of steps. 

However I‚Äôd often get instructions like:
Can you do A1, B2, and C3?

Ex: Can you read the article (but then each student gets a different article that have different things to focus on), write your thoughts (including your answers to three different questions) and then share out (in prearranged groups where we each discuss a question)?

I‚Äôll usually forget a step and since we have to do it in a certain time frame I‚Äôll usually do it wrong. Like, even if I understand the point of the assignment I won‚Äôt remember the questions, etc. That‚Äôs why I like assignments where there‚Äôs some room for creativity, almost. Or it‚Äôs simple so I can understand how to do it without having to think a lot about it.

Here is what I already tried:

1. Take a break after a certain amount of time.
2. Take a break after a specified amount of tasks done.
3. Take a break whenever I feel like it.

But the problem is...

1. this often results in either taking a break too early, or too late. Because some days I can focus for hours, some days no more than a minute, so it seems impossible to get a proper timing on when to take a break.
2. Same issue as 1... + there is no way to know how much time some tasks are really gonna take. So I will either take a break too early or too late.
3. My feeling has proven many times to be unreliable as well. I either just be too lazy and take a break when I dont really need it yet, or I somehow am too motivated to keep going even while my brain is already fried, which results in taking a break too late.

it seems IM POSSIBLE to properly schedule breaks into my day..

Got a dry-erase marker and write the time I started the thing right above the clock. That way when I come back into the room, having forgotten when I left (despite telling myself I wouldn't lol) I can see it right there.

I took Adderall for a short time, but it wasn't having any noticeable affects on the lower doses and it was so hard to get. So my doc switched me to Concerta (off brands of everything) a few months ago. I take a low medium dose (27mg I think). Anyway, I'm on vacation time this week from my job. So Thursday I left to visit my grandparents.

My mom came to feed my cats while I was gone. So before I left, I quickly did a few hours of cleaning so it would be somewhat presentable for her.

I take several meds for several conditions. On the tops I have them labeled. M=Morning. E=Evening. *=Both. When I finish a pill bottle, I throw it in a pile on my bathroom counter. I should just put it in the trash, but I don't. Sometimes the bottles roll around a bit or the cats will think they're toys and bat them around.

So before I left, I threw these empty pill bottles away. But I think I might of accidentally threw away my Concerta. I can't find it. I looked everywhere I can think of that the cats could have batted it. It's not there.

I had enough for today bc I packed an extra dose in case I got stuck there by a storm that was predicted. But I don't have any for tomorrow or after. I would guess that I had about 2 weeks left before my next refill. I don't know if this is how it works everywhere, but I've been told that because of the high control level, the doc can only give me one refill at a time. So every time I need a new bottle, the doctor has to send a new script. But I'm worried they won't give it to me or they'll suspect that I'm doing something illegal with it because if how controlled it is. I don't know what to do. I literally can't function without it. Last time I missed a dose, I slept most of the day, felt physically like garbage, and couldn't do anything besides play a stupid puzzle game on my phone.

During the day I feel very tired, have zero energy, and zero motivation. Sadness in general at any time of the day.

I tried Ritalin and Vyvanse. Stimulants work very well for me, they take away any symptoms I have, everything, and I just feel good. I feel the difference drastically, palpably. Unfortunately, however, both Ritalin (including prolonged releases) and Vyvanse don't last long for me (Methylphenidate XR around 3 Hours and Vyvanse around 4 Hours) and above all the crash is very, very strong, I become very anxious and paranoid. It's a rollercoaster, I go from feeling terrible to feeling great, and then falling back into the deepest depression.

with the doctor we evaluated the possibility of trying Selegiline (oral) which should also have an effect on ADHD symptoms including motivation and energy. At higher doses it loses selectivity and also acts on MAOA with an antidepressant effect given by the blockade of serotonin receptors.

I have read many experiences on selegeline, almost everyone has noticed an improvement in symptoms, especially those relating to motivation and tiredness.

I've been taking Selegiline, 30mg orally, for a MONTH and I haven't noticed any kind of improvement. in fact, the last period has been really bad. zero improvements, zero alleviation of symptoms, neither on the motivational aspect/ADHD nor on mood, depression, anxiety, etc.

could there be a reason? Has anyone had similar experiences?

Sometimes I start off well, then get tired and therefore awkwarder. Usually I‚Äôm just bad in general and in the rare moment, I might blend in decently. 

I just want to be able to start conversation. Continuing it after finding a topic to relate over? Fine. Starting it and managing small talk? It‚Äôs like I have something sewing my mouth shut. This is why I often wear band/movie shirts and such in hopes it‚Äôll start conversations.

I used was so quiet and polite back at school, that teachers either never had the courage or just didn't remember me enough to tell my parents about me never submitting homework on time or sometimes even at all.

Teachers assumed I was organised because it fit my sensible personality. But if they ever checked my folder, they'd find only 5 papers in there and the rest of the 300 papers missing.

Friends would be surprised when looking at the state of my locker. They thought I'd be neat and organised. Instead, there were papers flying out, and no system in place at all. Everything would be crumpled up.

I was so good at cramming that no one cared if I wasn't listening in class. At least my exam results were pretty good.I was so quiet as it was, that teachers didn't pay attention to my daydreaming.

I was clever enough to tell my parents I was doing homework on my computer. When really, I was playing video games.

I was clever enough to act like I was interested in doing my homework questions as a kid sitting alone in my room. I would wait for my parents to leave me alone, and then have a silent tantrum about how boring it was to sit down and do maths.

I only daydreamed excessively where I knew there would be no consequences.I never daydreamed a lot in classes where the teacher would pick on me to answer, because I was anxious about looking stupid in front of my peers.

* You think they will have a separate room for permit tests in order to stay focused on the questions and pass, but nope! At this DMV place though, none.

It made it pretty difficult for me to focus enough on the written test to pass it. In fact, I failed the first time and had to stand awkwardly for 2 minutes before retaking it.

* The second time, I passed! Well barely passed as I fully completed the permit test with about 7 wrong answers (The limit is 8 wrong answers where they automatically close the test program).

I am so happy that I passed. Now all I need to do is pass my Driver's test and I will officially have my Driver's License.

* My parents are currently for Driving School I could go in and practice how to drive because the cars there have brake pedals on both driver's and passenger's seats.

 Now, I‚Äôm taking four really hard courses and a bunch of labs all at the same time and it‚Äôs going horribly. I only started medication two months ago (because I was only recently diagnosed) so I don‚Äôt even know if my meds are working like they‚Äôre supposed to. I started off the first few weeks ok but then the labs started up and I‚Äôve fallen behind on everything. I had homework due every day but eventually I started falling behind on assignments and now it‚Äôs snowballed to where I am now.

I‚Äôve failed every midterm, i either don‚Äôt turn in homework anymore or do it only halfway and can‚Äôt muster up the motivation to do anything. I haven‚Äôt been to class in a few weeks (and attendance is graded, why‚Ä¶) . I‚Äôm actually really not sure if I can still turn things around and pass my classes. Idk what to do.

380,177fc38,t3_177fc38,AnonymousOnReddit99,5 minute focus blocks,"So I‚Äôm trying a new strategy for doing work and housework / life tasks. Setting an interval timer for 5 minute increments and rotating between 3 tasks. 

This seems extreme, as I am the type of person that doesn‚Äôt want to do cognitive work unless I have at least 60 if not 90 minutes to sit and focus on interrupted. So 5 minutes seems laughable but I kind of like this method. 

Even medicated, when I sit down to do my work, I get bored, and will interrupt myself if there isn‚Äôt an external distraction to rescue me from the task. Especially when I‚Äôm doing something that will take 20 or 30+ minutes to complete. I get bored and pick up my phone and check my email, etc. 

I realized that although I want long blocks to work, maybe I just can‚Äôt focus as long as I think I can.  Finding it‚Äôs easier to negotiate with myself to not pick up my phone, if I know I only have to focus for five minutes. I can wait that long to interrupt myself. In between 5 min, 30 seconds to check email/social media/text someone, etc. 

So it looks like this at home
1) 5 min of work (harder / cognitive work)
(30 second to distract myself if needed)
2) 5 min of work tasks (relying to emails, phone calls)
(30 seconds to distract myself if needed)
3) 5 min of tidying up or other chores.  Which allows me to get up and move
(30 seconds to distract myself if needed)

Repeat 3 more times for 60 min. Which is 20 min on harder work, 20 min on shorter work tasks, 20 min moving around and doing housework. 

At my office, part 3 can be: bathroom break, getting coffee/tea, snack, doing a couple laps around the office, or doing physical activity in my office with the door closed. Like stretching, jumping jacks, lunges, toe raises, a wall squat. 

Still trying it out at work. At home I‚Äôm on day 3 and I think it‚Äôs working well.

I‚Äôve taken the first 10mg (3 times a day) yesterday, I barely notice any difference, the only difference I felt was my legs didn‚Äôt shake as much? I‚Äôve had restless legs and hands my whole life, I always shake my legs, my hands are always fidgeting, but yesterday after taking my medication I kind of felt my legs tingling, like they wanted to shake, but they didn‚Äôt, so it‚Äôs just this uncomfortable tingling, and when I shook them deliberately I just didn‚Äôt feel the same satisfaction like I felt my whole life. Has anyone experienced the same thing?

As for the side effects, I feel like I am in constant hunger, but my appetite is DESTROYED, I just don‚Äôt feel like eating. I also experience some headaches, like 3-4 hours in, but it was worse when I took 5mg, it‚Äôs not as bad when I take the new dose.

I took my first dose today earlier, and I felt the same tingling on my legs (and my hands I think but I wasn‚Äôt really sure), as for other symptoms, I also barely notice anything different, I still get distracted all the time, I still can‚Äôt focus, it‚Äôs all the same (but I also think that I might have not put that much attention on noticing it). I am planning to do some work today and see if my focus has improved. 

So has anyone experienced the same thing (especially the tingling)? Is this a normal response? What should I expect from this dose? I‚Äôm very new to this so I‚Äôd like to get some new insights. Feel free to share your experience with this medication too!

It's more akin to my self perception of the attitude I have towards the tasks I've been given. Year after Year after Year I've been in school and struggled so ridiculously hard with the work I've been assigned and are barely keeping up with it only to end up smoking the end of year placement tests and keep getting put into more and more difficult classes. The busy work assigned to us in schools is complete garbage.

I also tend to find myself overthinking things quite a bit too much and have a incredibly strange pathway when comes to topics in a conversation for example. It makes it difficult because I have to intentionally dumb down the words I say because I'll end up using something super big and people will look at me like I'm a jackass trying to sound smart. Unfortunately due to trying to do this I now end up getting both figuratively and literally tongue tied quite often.
I've even been having issues with the hobbies I enjoy because they end up where I don't feel engaged and can't focus on it at all because even though I enjoy it there's no challenge.

The amount of pressure put on me to succeed is much more than a normal person because of how much I overachieve on certain things, they end up expecting that amount of work out of me for a lot more and it's ended up in me burning myself out of my jobs.

Blissful Ignorance is important for sure, because people who don't worry about things don't have to deal with the stress of their performance and social anxiety to succeed someone with a overwhelming intellect does.

Trying to be as objective as possible, i would describe myself as creative, fun, intelligent, outgoing and nice. Im also forgetful, distractible, emotional, impulsive, can talk too much/overshare . 

I‚Äôm coming off of a 2-year post-diagnosis depression where i learned why people have always disliked me particularly when they are my roommates, parents, bosses, teachers or friends.

I‚Äôm getting cured for depression and taking adhd meds and it‚Äôs helped a lot with my organization/executive function. 

However, I‚Äôm still struggling socially with a very familiar pattern. People find me different, weird, a jerk , too much or whatever it is. Or they pick up on my anxiety or quirks. So they begin to pick on me/bully/gossip or scapegoat me in social dynamics. This has happened a lot over the years. when i was younger, i lacked the self awareness and probably did many things to justify said behavior from others according to them. 

Now I‚Äôm hyper aware and super conscious, however i still get the same behavior in a new workplace even as i walked around timid trying not to do anything to get judged. As i get better from depression, i lm getting my confidence back and decided to stop walking around like a scaredy cat. I‚Äôve started to give the people that pick on me or have this weird need to judge me and put me down to feel better about themselves the same energy. I ‚Äúgrey rock‚Äù them, interact  only professionally and try to call out disrespect when i see it and not let it slide as i used to. 

I regret not standing up for myself when i was younger and feel this is my redemption. I‚Äôm trying to accept myself despite what others may think about me. 

However, the part of me that is deeply scared of others judgement is still affected by the hostile body language and passive aggressiveness  of these coworkers.

I can imagine detailed pictures and whatever pretty alright. Can imagine smells. I can imagine things in motion aswell...but not for long

It's like..if it was a video certain frames or seconds of it are just lost when I'm trying to imagine things in motion? Like I can imagine a crisp green and red apple rotating and flying through the air, water droplets falling off it but I can't keep it up for more than a few seconds before my mind almost wanders and forgets about it/loses focus for a bit, before I force it to imagine it again.

Super weird. It's incredibly hard to keep it going for a long time. I've always thought my imagination was pretty good but this limit that I somehow only now discovered is so odd and terrifying. Sort of shows the problems with my memory and ability to focus. I really often imagine or think about the same things over and over starting from scratch each time because I've lost focus and need to trace my steps again. Whilst this does happen with imagining still images too, it's far more obvious when thinking of moving things. Is this relatable to anyone? And is it an ADHD thing or is this normal?

I do have some productivity strategies and they kind of work... But only a little bit. I'm nowhere near the amount of productivity that I desire. I spend far too many hours per day on the useless side of the internet. Its not necessarily that im addicted. Its just that I spend alot of time at my pc, and that im easily distracted when trying to do something that requires brainpower, and so that leads to reddit, youtube, etc..

For context, I'm based in Latin America so my options are limited. The first thing I tried was Provigil, for less than a month and I hated it. Sleep felt unrestful, I had a constant feeling sort of in between a headache and dizziness. From there, my psych switched me to Strattera, 25mg. 

At first I had absolutely no side effects (no effects either), but now two weeks in approximately, I am getting the same feeling of headache mixed with dizziness (made worse whenever I forget a dose), and still no effects. From what I've read here, apparently I'm on a really low dose, and getting to 80mg is the sweet spot for most people. However, I'm worried about side effects worsening. Some people here have stated that if you can handle a couple of months with side effects, they eventually go away.

My psych asked me to try Strattera out for a month, and so in my next visit I either tell him I can continue with it or ask him to switch to something else, which we already discussed would be Ritalin.

I do think depression was largely caused by my undiagnosed ADHD and I'd like to eventually quit it, or at least switch it to Wellbutrin, because I've read that it's a better option for us ADHD folks.

**20mg** \- no effect at all - neutral

**30mg** \- 7 days: I felt dizzy, unfocused and overstimulated - negative

So my psychiatrist upped my dosage because he said that it can happen that too low of a dosage an cause overstimulation effects.

**40mg** \- 7 days: no dizzyness, no overstimulation

one day with 4 hours of good calm focus

6 days with 2 hours of good focus

So better, but very short durations. I still ""felt"" the medication after the focus disappeared. I got cold hands and had a slightly increased heart rate. So its not like its completely gone, but the positive effects were gone. I felt it immediately because all my physical ticks came back (nail biting and shit).

Now he moved me up to 60mg to see if it would increase the duration of the therapeutic effect.

**60mg** \- 2 days

I just... felt nothing? No side effects, no comedown, no focus. Just an increased heart rate as usual. But not even the cold hands. I'm very confused now. Is it possible that a higher dosage just does nothing? I mean it is only 2 days but still...Has anyone experienced something like this before? :S I mean there is a chance that 50mg is the sweet spot, but i doubt that i get more than 2-4 hours of focus out of it. Which sucks.

446,176hz3t,t3_176hz3t,TeenyWeenyQueeny,There‚Äôs no escaping ADHD.,"I don‚Äôt even know how to start but I am so thankful for this subreddit.

The signs were there since childhood. Constantly bored, 101 hobbies but didn‚Äôt master a single one, enthusiastic and excelled at creative subjects, constantly seeking food to fuel my need for dopamine leading to childhood and inevitably adulthood obesity, below average/average grades despite being described as a bright student and generally an intelligent child, constantly getting in trouble for daydreaming and missing homework and these signs have followed me into adulthood and employment. 
I am a serial job hopper and haven‚Äôt stayed in a position for more than 2 years. I excel at interviews and underperform in the role. I chase the high of securing a new job and when I get it, lose interest almost immediately. I hate working in a team and prefer to work alone. My need for money to survive keeps me in work as does my insurmountable debt caused by impulse shopping and poor decisions . I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to feel so passionately about something that can also generate an income.

In contrast, My fianc√© was a straight A student, attended one of the top universities in my country and graduated with one of the highest grades in his class. He now works in a senior position in an industry he‚Äôs genuinely passionate about - he literally writes papers about it for fun outside working hours. This is foreign to me. I can‚Äôt wait to escape work regardless of what I do.
He‚Äôs so supportive of my struggles and begs me to tell him when I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed but sometimes I don‚Äôt even realise until I‚Äôve crashed. 

I am undiagnosed but I have multiple online assessments and tested positive for ADHD. I‚Äôve been reluctant to pay the high cost for a formal diagnosis but today was the last straw; I am on the verge of losing my new job because already I‚Äôm showing signs of poor performance and it has been noted by senior management, despite feeling burnt out. I knew this would happen but didn‚Äôt expect it so soon. I‚Äôve been told if I don‚Äôt improve I won‚Äôt pass my probation.

I have an ok income that's not great, but it's bearable.
I'm paying out a loan, phone contact, and a few other services.
However, my expenses aren't high enough to not be able to save any money.

I should be able to put aside roughly ¬£300 a month, yet I ride on a rollercoaster of money and whenever I save up around ¬£600 I have to throw it all back into my bank account because I realised I was spending yet again way too much money and for into overdraft.

Partly it's because of impulsive spending.
And I suspect that the fact I was abused and neglected as a child by the family (and wasn't able to have or get nothing at all from the things I wanted), I simply buy almost right away whatever item I feel like I need.

The question is, how do I go around it?
How do I get to stop spending money on stuff that I might not even need, yet feel like it might be a good idea to have it? (I'm happy with most of the purchases despite of not necessarily needing the stuff).

I avoid it some days because I want to avoid the anxiousness, and typically don't take it on the weekend. I'm wondering whether I should try to get habituated or just go ahead and ask my doctor for a lower dose as I feel I'm pretty sensitive to it.

Since then had a hell of a year of it (a lot of good things, but very energy sapping) which has caused me to experience burnout a couple of times. During the moments of burnout, and afterwards I am very content with just ""being"" whilst the battery charges up. In the past I would white knuckle it and just plow through for months until I eventually feel into (what I thought at the time was) depression. (Now reframed as, burnout).

Fast forward to now and I am learning to be protective over my time and energy. I get excited about others projects, but don't jump in to help them. I let things come to me. I also have less of a problem saying no to people as I would rather feel bad for not doing something than resenting them because it maxed me out. 

What I am finding quite frustrating is that on a handful of times people have said pushed the point of ""Are you okay"" - which I know is a caring response, but it has me second guessing how I am being perceived. I am a very open person and take a kind approach to how I communicate, so as I have gone through this process I have been keen to ensure people don't feel like its a ""them"" thing. 

The problem I am finding with this is it then puts me in a state of ""But am I okay?"" ""Do I not seem okay?!"" which in turn makes me second guess myself, when I know that I am..infact..doing great since working on myself.

I try to keep things in place like going on a walk if I'm struggling to work and just sitting in my room but half the time I just forget to do these things and only remember after I've spent like 4 or 5 hours doing nothing.

Just thought I'd share a little update on my experiences with Strattera/Atomoxetine, and possibly some advice for those who are in a similar situation to myself. A little bit of background, I am a college student who was recently diagnosed with ADHD-I after years of advocacy. I was started on Prozac for my anxiety and am currently on 40 mg with good overall benefits to my mood, but nothing for my inattentiveness.

I started taking atomoxetine (18 mg) in combination with my Prozac about 4 weeks ago. The decision to start on atomoxetine was mostly due to me taking other psychopharmaceuticals, while also working evening/night shift (3p-3a), which makes taking a stimulant relatively more difficult given the advice that I've received from coworkers. I had side effects similar to most: nausea, headache, hypertension, tachycardia, and *especially* fatigue. While the nausea and headache have subsided, I am still especially more tired than normal, sleeping well past 8 hours with little motivation to wake up. As a whole, I still feel that my inattentiveness has not improved, but I also understand that I'm still very early into this medication and not at the strongest of doses. 

I just wanted to share and see if anyone had some similar experiences and possibly some advice on how to proceed. While my side effects are not completely debilitating, this fatigue is still something I have to be aware of and it is affecting my life slightly.

473,1772gkf,t3_1772gkf,Nice-Ad-5634,Should I get tested for ADHD?,"  
   Hi, I'm a 16-year-old female who may have ADHD.  
For quite some time I've been thinking about getting tested for ADHD. I share a lot of the symptoms and my dad has it as well.  I struggle with pretty much almost everything my dad struggles with because of his ADHD. Even at one point when I was seeing a counselor she said that there is a good chance I probably have it.  


All of these things have led me to think there is a chance I have it. The problem is that my mom doesn't want me to get tested. She thinks if I get diagnosed it will forever be on my medical record and people won't want to hire me in the future because of it. She is also concerned that they will just give me a bunch of medicine and drug me up. I understand her concern and have told her at the end of the day it's my decsion if I want to take the medicine or not.  


Honestly, the reason why I want to get tested is for peace of mind. I'm quiet tired of knowing something is not right but I can't say it's ADHD because I haven't been diagnosed. I feel like it might make my life a little bit easier knowing the reason I'm like this. But the problem is I'm worried what my mother said is true. I'm not sure what to do. Do you guys think I should get tested?

He had a couple of jobs years ago, one of them he seemed to like and then he got burnt out and ended up leaving. Later  he had a big depression and he hasn't worked since. It's been a while. Around 7 years. 

Now, the thing is... he never actually looks for jobs. He tried working at 2 different places last year but he got really upset about certain behaviours about his employers and eventually got disencouraged about the pay and left.
He hasn't looked for a job ever since. He's just waiting for his diagnosis and medication to fix everything. Can his attitude be because of ADHD? Or this has just more to do with the fact that he just doesn't wanna work and he's not interested in working? Cause he keeps complaining about how tight things are and how he's not able to do things he could do before, but he's not trying to do anything to fix that!

492,177110t,t3_177110t,manykeets,Found out I‚Äôm not autistic. My doctor thinks my social deficiencies are caused by my ADHD.,"I always thought I was autistic because I‚Äôm so socially inept. Growing up as a kid, nobody liked me because I was weird and annoying. I was too hyper and silly, talked too much, etc. When I realized nobody liked me, I became aware I was different. I started observing other people and tried to copy their behavior, hoping I could learn to act ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù This just made it worse because I couldn‚Äôt pull it off. Eventually I gave up, so I withdrew from everyone and stopped talking. That‚Äôs when my depression and social anxiety started. I‚Äôm officially diagnosed with both. 

So for years, I thought I was autistic because I didn‚Äôt know how to properly socialize. I always said the wrong thing and often offended people without knowing why. I know this is common with people on the spectrum. 

So I talked to my psychiatrist about my concerns. She said I‚Äôm not autistic. She works with a lot of autistic patients, and I don‚Äôt fit the profile. She said my untreated ADHD was what caused the behavior that people rejected me for. She said I should seek therapy to deal with the feelings of rejection and low self-esteem that it caused. 

I believe her. I think she‚Äôs right because autism doesn‚Äôt run in my family. She really helped me understand my childhood, and now I have answers.

I (27 F) don't want to get into my full backstory, but basically my GP gave me the suspected diagnosis of ADD. I've always thought that I had it, everything points to it.   
I am currently on a waiting list at a clinic that focuses on ADHD/ADD and Autism. I probably won't get an actual appointment till next year.  


My issue at the moment is my memory, or the lack thereof. I constantly keep forgetting things at work.   
One great example (one that has happened to me several times in the last 3 years) is me answering a call, receiving information that I have to give to one of my colleagues. I forget, and hours later one of my colleagues answers a call about the same issue, comes up to me and asks me 'did you talk to xyz?' and I tell them 'no.', because I literally think I didn't.   
At this point, my colleagues think I'm a compulsive liar, but I genuinely forgot that I even talked to 'xyz'. Usually, about a couple of hours later, I'll have an epiphany and remember.   
I feel like I'm going insane. I'm probably going to get fired in the future. Who would want to keep a worker who doesn't do their job right?  


Notes don't work, because I just never look at them again. The schedules on my phone don't work because I forget them the moment I take my eyes off of my phone.   
I genuinely don't know what to do. I know I'm not stupid, but lately I feel like I am.   
It also bothers me that it's an issue that I can't explain to anyone at work. I'm not diagnosed yet and even if I am, the diagnosis doesn't change anything as I'll probably keep being forgetful.

520,176vvw9,t3_176vvw9,Hick-ford,How to deal with later life diagnosis trauma/resentment.,"I (29M) have just recently been diagnosed with ADHD Trauma might be a heavy word, but I can't help but look back at the past and hold resentment for times when the signs have been loud and clear when I was a child but no one had said anything, even the intellectual adults/safeguards like teachers or doctors.

I remember particularly a time when I was in Year 3 of Primary school (UK), third grade ect. I would never be paying attention, always doodling in my book, or staring off blankly into space in my own vivid imagination, I never got learning assistance like some of the problematic kids did, but I remember this one time particularly and it really festers within me during a parent teacher conference. 

The situation: The Teacher told my parents that my learning seems to be slipping and that I might not be able to see that well, I might need glasses, no one was transparent with me or would ask me if that was the case, we went straight to the opticians, got the tests done, 20/20 vision, still hold that to this day. BUT THAT WAS IT, nothing after that, no further investigation, no suggestions, nothing, just a stamp on my head that just made me out to be a stupid child. Of course at the time I didn't understand or comprehend what was happening but in retrospect I'm so angry and I find it hard to move on from that.

I'm already trying to come with to terms of not letting ADHD being an excuse for who I am or how I turned out to be and I'm trying to not let it be an excuse when a problem arises in future, Ive got to where I am through learning and growing, I'm not too sure if anyone shares that sentiment with me, it's just how I choose to deal with it, sounds toxic but it's my comfort.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/176vvw9/how_to_deal_with_later_life_diagnosis/,True,2023-10-13 10:45:58,False,8,False,False,5,0.86,/r/ADHD/comments/176vvw9/how_to_deal_with_later_life_diagnosis/

I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm in love with the game, but oh boy, things like the inventory management is seriously draining me. It's like I have this urge to hoard everything, from books to random items that I don't even have a clue about. And what do I do? I end up just sending all stuff to camp, thinking to myself, ""Yeah, I'll totally read this book during my downtime in camp!"" But let's be real, that hardly ever happens. And when I finally go through the traveler's chest, it feels like a whole ordeal because I can't even remember where half of these specific letters, books and items are from. It gets a little frustrating because I really want to know everything about the lore, but I just feel a bit lost.
Oh and destroying an item that I am not sure if it will be useful for something later on feels like torture to me xD

Also about the quests, they give me such a serious case of FOMO. There are just so many ways to go about them that every decision feels like I might be locking myself out of something awesome. I mean, what if I progress to the next act or rest at camp and the quest is lost forever? It just triggers me when I see a quest log with some vague description...like ""where, with whom, and when can I do that?"" 

But in spite of all that, I absolutely adore the game. The character dialogue is just top-notch, and it truly captures the DND vibe. The gripping story and the fact that you can follow different paths just add to the amazing experience.

541,176qekm,t3_176qekm,zoekki,Slight improvement in focus after starting medication,"Hi all! Always been a lurker but never posted.

23F, just wanted to share that I took my first dose today, Concerta 18mg. Doc started me on the lowest dose possible (apparently it's the kids dose xD) because I'm underweight and he was worried about the potential appetite loss.

I didn't get the feeling of euphoria that many people described upon taking their very first dose, but I think there has been a small improvement. In the past, while watching a lecture, I'd feel an urge to be doing anything but watch the lecture. And I'd act on those urges, open a new tab, and that's it, it'll be hours before I get back on task.

Today though, I still felt the pull to do something else, check my messages, anything. But it felt like I had more control, the ability to force myself to stay on task. Say no to those urges. And they also happen less frequently, I think.

It isn't a magic pill that makes me a master of concentrating and never getting distracted, but the ability to exert some control over it (definitely does take effort!) is new to me, and I think it's a step in the right direction?

Not gonna lie, I was expecting the change to be more pronounced - something like, ""is this how easy it should've been my whole life?"" But regardless, I would still consider this a win for me. I don't know, it's all new and fresh xD

Basically, 31 year old male. I have an ADHD diagnosis from my younger years, however due to having shitty parents, I haven‚Äôt been on my medication since I was about 16-17. I was prescribed Vyvanse, from what I remember it made everything easier for me, school, focus, even helping some social anxiety. I remember trying many medications, concerta yada yada but the one that worked was Vyvanse. 

I‚Äôm now older, I have a career. I somehow was able to pass paramedic school (studying was hell, I don‚Äôt know how I did it) and I now for the first time in my adult life have health insurance. This brought me to kind of a ‚Äúah hah‚Äù moment. 

Ive been having internal struggles for as long as I can remember in my adult life. I‚Äôm lazy about the weirdest things. For example if I‚Äôm sitting on the shower I don‚Äôt want to stand to get a bottle of soap, why? No idea. Just don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôve hyper fixated on so many hobbies as an adult that I‚Äôve probably lost $10,000 on random stuff. Seen a salt water aquarium? Cool - here‚Äôs to a 2 month long salt water addiction that costed me thousands that I got bored of. Seen a woodworking tiktok? I bought hundreds of dollars of tools to only throw away the hobby a month later. I can‚Äôt stand to look people on their eyes when talking, it makes me uncomfortable to the point I‚Äôll actually avoid people, and not just like ‚Äúevery now and then people‚Äù. I do it with my parents and family too. I‚Äôve tried to read books because I really want to read books but if I sit down and try to read my hands start to feel ‚Äúfast‚Äù and I can‚Äôt focus.

I have been struggling for a very long time and running away from a lot of the problems within my life. A major issue is that I really ruminate and procrastinate instead of working on extremely important things, mainly because I am extremely distractible and horrible at stress management. This last year, I flopped out of university which has forced me to take a mandatory academic leave before turning back next year. I took a lot of time thinking about what actually went wrong, and I think a lot of it is rooted in my stress management. I start off the year very strong, before plummeting into a horrible burn out and basically crying every day and wishing everything would stop. In jest, **I have a serious issue with constantly running away from my problems.** I think it's really because **I don't know how to handle the negative emotions that comes with facing my problems.**

I have been considering finding a therapist but have been completely overwhelmed with where to begin and what treatments I should seek to work on my stress-handling abilities. I really want to be able to implement strategies prior to next year, and \*hopefully\* graduate, because... as for right now... I know that I can't do it solely because it would cause back-to-back mental breakdowns. I really want to finish university but it is so gut-wrenchingly overwhelming and painful it totally turns me into another person. It's EXTRA difficult because I know there are certain practices that help with stress, such as mindfulness and self-care... but in a moment that extends from days to weeks to months of intense overwhelm, I find it extremely hard to ""pull away"" from the stress and allow myself to relax. And when I do... it plummets into a burn out where I can't pick myself back up.

Does anyone have any advice on what kind of therapy I should do? Anyone share a similar experience? Please help. I really want to get my degree and continue with my life.

(Also, I am medicated. The medication helps a lot in noticing my ADHD tendencies but does very little in changing them.

I want to understand what I experience a bit better, so I'm hoping someone with medical knowledge or anyone who can make an educated guess can help me out here.

Not enough to feel pain, but it's noticeable. In the first few weeks I had immediate headaches but I learnt that taking magnesium immediately fixed the issue, so now I have magnesium everyday. 

However, the intersting thing is, about 3 hours in I get a sudden relief from this pressure in my head, and it almost feels...cool? It's hard to explain but it's like a very dialled down version of like menthol coolness (as in it feels physically cooler in my head). 

Can anyone explain this phenomenon? Does anyone else experience this? It's so distinct and fairly quick transition, the adding on of pressure first and then the quick release a few hours later (while my meds are still working).

- Not able to stick to one note taking app
- Become super overwhelmed by my own notes: it‚Äôs very chaotic and everything is just too much. 
- I lose the overview of the objective, even if I quickly read through the paper and write down the main topics.
- I can‚Äôt let go of details, I HAVE to understand everything before I move on. 
- I struggle with writing a concise summary/section of a paper. 
- I become overwhelmed of all my problems and I get anxiety paralysis/procrastination. I know what you are gonna say, just start, and I do. That‚Äôs where I start to hyperfocus on a single detail which is not that important. 
Honestly idk even know at this point.. there are so many things. 
Is there someone who has a bit of experience in this field and has some tips maybe? I‚Äôve tried to so many things but nothing really seems to help. 
I would really appreciate all the help!!!

Also I love this field, that‚Äôs not the issue.


Edit: What I do so far

- Accountability:
I have weekly meetings with my supervisors during which I end the meeting with a clear To Do list and deadline. The next week we usually go through my work and so on. (Usually my work is projected onto a large screen which makes it even more embarrassing üòÇ) 
I also try to finish at least 1-2 days before the deadline( which I fail at miserably) so I can proof read. 

- Note-taking:
I try to use Notion since it has a toggle feature so I don‚Äôt become overwhelmed by all the text. 
I try to make headings at the start of my new doc and place the text I think is useful for me under a specific heading. However, I have to use word ofc for the actual doc when I hand it in. 

-  Reading articles strategy: 
I try to start with the abstract and introduction, I write down the most important stuff so I keep focusing on that. Then I read the discussion and try to place the info I read there to the research questions/objectives I read in the abstract and introduction. 
When the article is very important and it‚Äôs crucial to read the methodology etc. I read that and try to incorporate it in my already written notes. Or I place all of my important notes directly in the doc with the headings that are specific to my paper if the article is quite similar. 

 - Task planning
I use LunaTask. I can make goals within a certain life area and track my progress, wonderful app, however I just don‚Äôt stick to it when I‚Äôm stressed. I forget to use it and even if I use it the whole time, stuff still doesn‚Äôt really work cuz I tend to take too much time on a specific task and I have an extremely hard time to let go of a task/detail.

566,176jufa,t3_176jufa,RyanBleazard,The opposite of ADHD - giftedness in executive functioning/self-regulation,"The executive functions consist of self-motivation, working memory, inhibition, emotional regulation, persistence, foresight and hindsight.

We can think of the executive functions simply as those capacities of self-control that permit us to inhibit our behaviour and sustain action and problem solving towards a goal. They are unique to humans.

Here is the continuum of EF in the population, which, we can represent as a bell curve: [https://ibb.co/r0XLwjS](https://ibb.co/r0XLwjS)

One can acknowledge that ADHD represents the extreme left end of the distribution. Here those at the extreme lower end of this trait experience harm and impairment.

Following from there (roughly 1 to 1 1/2 deviations below the mean) you reach an area that is symptomatic but not diagnosable. These people may not get a diagnosis, and if you want to call them an ADHD personality, they‚Äôre just sort of sparkling, effervescent and talkative, gregarious, a little impulsive, probably extroverted, that's fine but they're not impaired by their symptoms so they don't have a disorder.

The centre or mean is the typical population ranging from below average to above average.

And the ones way up on the right side of the bell curve are people who are just completely able to self-regulate themselves better than anyone else, which is in essence, the opposite of ADHD.

Those gifted in EF in my opinion are likely to become heads of corporations or other businesses or incredibly productive in other fields such as science departments or managing entire universities of medical centres. I would see the, as far more productive than the typical part of the curve.

It accounts for roughly 3-4% percent of the population, about the same percentage as ADHD (3-5%). A little lower as, unlike with some non-genetic cases of ADHD that result from frontal-lobe damage, giftedness is not acquirable.

569,17602hg,t3_17602hg,Tiny_Loan4863,"I was abused as a child growing up, mostly for symptoms of my adhd.","Growing up, I was abused by both of my parents, it ranged from emotional abuse, emotional neglect, threats of public humiliation to slaps. 
My parents are not able to handle their emotions, let alone the emotions of others. They will let off steam by (in my dad's case) throwing or kicking things, yelling at people and (in my mom's case) yelling at and hitting others. Growing up with them was thus difficult especially as a child with adhd and executive dysfunction. Most of the abuse I experienced as a kid was because of symptoms of my adhd/executive dysfunction, especially regarding keeping my room clean. I'd cry and tell them over and over that I just can't do it and I don't know why. But they didn't believe it because I could sometimes do it, so according to them I obviously was doing it on purpose. I had to explicitly explain to my mom that that was actually just how executive dysfunction works. And she still doesn't want to admit that their abuse toward me was traumatizing. Because they had to, because ""I wasn't fully innocent either"" (I screamed back at them, and had fits of anger - obviously not normal behavior for a child below the age of 10, as they seem to think with all classic bad behavior of young children, because kids have to be more in control of themselves than they are). According to my mom, nothing is wrong with hitting your children, she was hit and ""she turned out fine"" (yeah, I can see that with the way you're incapable of handling your own emotions and act like a child would). 
I have so much trouble speaking out about struggling things with my disability because of this, I feel so much shame still regarding so much of disability. I can't ask for help, even if I want to because of the way my parents were reacting to it. 
I honestly don't even know how to view it. My mom had me convinced for years that this was totally normal parenting. And even now I know it's not, I still have my doubts, the constant worry about it. What if I truly am just being dramatic and making things out to be worse than they actually are? What if it's truly normal to treat your kids like that?

&#x200B;

*Now, the essay I typed before I wrote the actual question, haha:*

So I've been diagnosed 3.5 years ago with ADHD and depression. I'm currently 30. In the Netherlands, you can only get so few sessions with your psychologist with your health insurance. Then I got an ADHD coach paid for by the government and then, due to a reorganisation for better quality (I read budget cuts), for the past half year I only have a regular generalized coach. 

&#x200B;

They offered me an online workbook module (Gezondeboel) to learn better setting and achieving goals. I haven't got to the meat of it yet. I should work on it more in my own time, but I forget and when I do think of it, I feel a resistance. It feels like homework, which doesn't help. I also felt like I got better, more concrete help with experienced ADHD coaches.

&#x200B;

I do want to work on myself, but I'm struggling with this. Before I go beating myself up, I just want to know more about how this fits into ADHD. I can see that my perspective might not help, e.g. on the coaching or seeing it as homework. On the other hand, having this gut reaction might be telling enough. That's why I want to know if it's me (whether It's just not for me or I'm being dramatic and need to get over myself) or if workbook methods aren't for most people with ADHD.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/176hse5/do_online_workbooks_for_adhd_work_for_you/,True,2023-10-12 21:19:18,False,7,False,False,2,0.67,/r/ADHD/comments/176hse5/do_online_workbooks_for_adhd_work_for_you/

I (23 M) have been going to a therapist for a little over 3 months now who I like a lot. She specializes in ADHD folks, mainly for ADHD in children. She is very convinced that I have inattentive ADHD, and by the way she talks about it in my life, I am also pretty convinced. However, within these 3 months I've seen two difference psychiatrist. One I saw twice, and the other I just saw today. Both of these psychiatrist believe I have Bipolar disorder, and depression/anxiety. The psychiatrist I saw today diagnosed me within 20 minutes, saying I only scored 2/6. The first prescribed me Wellbutrin which has been extremely helpful, but my therapist said it has probably been helpful since I have a dopamine deficiency, as a result of the ADHD. 

  
Do any of you think that my therapist is thinking I have ADHD, since that's what she specializes in? Or do you think it is more likely that I am being misdiagnosed by the psychiatrist? I more so believe the psychiatrist are wrong since they are basing their diagnoses of a 20-40 minute meeting, and my therapist is basing it off of our first 6 one hour meetings.

It started in junior high when he needed tutoring for some rough grades and slipping academic performance. He grew resentful of the tutoring (Kumon) and how it impacted his free time. After that growing resentment he started getting angry around any parental oversight, reminder, or chores. Alot of this anger he directed towards his step mom, who he's known since he was a toddler. 

We started regular therapy about 3 years. We've been through 4 Therapists, 2 who basically quit, 1 who moved practices, and his current therapist who is OK. He attends therapy but doesn't participate all that much. He has adhd and anxiety medication managed by a psychologist.

Since things had deteriated so much between him and his step-mom, I took basically the sole parenting role since if he got verbally or physically abusive I was more able to handle it. I used to be able to talk him down from his explosive anger but that's happening less and less. He's getting more physical with me, shoving, prodding, and throwing things to hurt me. 

This behavior is limited largely to home. He is quiet mostly out of the house. His main grievances are interruptions to gaming. Something as simple as someone entering a room he's in can set him off. 

I'm losing faith in his ability to manage his temper. It seems to be getting worse. I'm losing faith in my ability to handle him. Therapy doesn't seem to be making progress. Medication doesn't seem to be making progress. 

Early on in the process, my fiance (his step mom) said we should consider therapeutic boarding school. I've resisted that for years at this point. I'm scared that I'm failing him as it is, but I'm also scared what sending him off somewhere will do. 

He doesn't do drugs to my knowledge. He's been detained for shoplifting once, but besides that no legal run-ins. My fear is if his mental health continues to deteriated eventually he will go down a violent criminal path.

I‚Äôm a student in my last year of college. 
In early September, I‚Äôve passed an exam to access a part of my area that is very specific. 

I‚Äôve dream about that my whole life, it was my one and only true goal. 

Because of my ADHD, I‚Äôve always thought that it would only stay just a dream. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I believe in myself but this area is just so difficult to access in my country and I didn‚Äôt have the rigor or the concentration to work enough.

The thing is I got to the point where I had all the conditions checked in order to present myself for this exam (you have to posses certain type of degree etc to present yourself) so I applied to take the exam.

At first, I didn‚Äôt knew how to work but then I forced myself to take my medication again every day (I didn‚Äôt like to take it every day during college, only on day I had to study). I started to work on a schedule and on maintaining it.
I worked my a** off during 2 full months to learn everything, my days were composed of 7-8hour of full study. 
I did the exact same task every day whether I was happy or not, whether I was determined or not. I cried a lot and thought about dropping everything. But in the end, I didn‚Äôt stop because I knew that in this moment, what I was doing was the right thing. 
And for others, it may seem normal but for me it was such a big achievement ! I‚Äôve never done that in my whole life before. 

The day of the first exam, on my way to college, I started crying. I was so emotional and proud of myself. My whole life I thought that I could never be enough or never have the rigor and the determination to chase dream that big. 
But that day, I was showing myself for the first time that I was as prepared and as qualified as the best person that showed to the exam class. 

The thing is I‚Äôm going to have my results next week and I truly don‚Äôt know if I will succeed or not. But I‚Äôm so f****** proud of myself, I‚Äôve never felt like that before and whatever happen, this feeling is not going to change.

I wanted to remind everyone here that we‚Äôre more than capable of succeeding. That we‚Äôre different but that doesn‚Äôt mean that we can‚Äôt be better than the others.
I wanted to write for all of you who were waiting for a sign to start college, start a buisness, take new responsibility, etc 
Go take that test, go apply to that post, go try to build that buisness because you have everything in you to succeed. Don‚Äôt stop yourself because you think that this is going to be harder for us, the human mind is capable of so much things and I‚Äôm sure everything is going to work out for all of you. 

I don‚Äôt know if I will succeed but what I do know is that I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôm capable and this is just the beginning.

If she was working hard on her studies and got these grades, I wouldn't mind much. But instead, she's not. She's not even opening the textbook. She just plays the Sims for hours and hours instead of studying or getting her homework done. I tried to work with her, help her make study plans and hold her accountable, but it doesn't work. She either ignores me completely and plays the Sims, or gets furious at me when I point out she promised to study. It's been really hurting me, and I'm starting to take it really personally. 

Recently, I thought it might be ADHD (I mean it's obvious now but in the moment it wasn't). So I encouraged her to see a therapist and get it diagnosed if it was. Within a few meetings, the therapist was pretty certain she had it. I don't want to pry into what they talk about, but it's been since July and I haven't seen much progress. Her midterm grades finally came back, and they're still pretty low. She still isn't studying, and continues to play the Sims all day instead. I've talked to her about it a few times, but they usually turn into ugly arguments. She gets mad at me and says ""I can't understand her because my brain works differently"" and she ""has no hands to do what she needs to do."" And honestly, I don't understand it. All I know is that she promised me she'd be working on it. But don't see her working on it! I see the same bad grades. I see the same procrastination. I see the same anger. And it's so difficult for me because I'm able to get my homework done on time, I'm able to study when I need to, and I don't understand why she just doesn't do it. 

Basically, I just want to know if anyone has gone through something similar with their partner. How can I support her? How can I help her? How can I protect myself through this?

I used to be able to read articles and was well-versed in feminist and gender theory. I would look up a lot of stuff and actually learn but now it's impossible for me to grasp anything that is abstract and/or theoretical. It's like I have no understanding ability whatsoever, every time I try to acquire some knowledge it feels like it just leaves my brain as soon as it enters it.  
  
I feel like that also applies to aspects of my daily life. Whenever someone explains something to me, I don't get it. When I get sent links to text or videos or whatever I don't feel like checking it out because my brain feels sooo tired. Sometimes I don't even reply to ""serious"" conversations that would require some thinking and assesssment before replying.  
  
Creatively speaking as well, I can't come up with stuff anymore. My writing feels bland and plain. I can't come up with things to draw or graphics to make in Photoshop anymore. It's like a part of my brain is blocked, or like instead of being an organ it's either a scrambled egg or a runny pancake sprawled all over the place. (That's the best way I can describe it haha)

My therapist has suggested tracking my time, writing how long I estimate something will take, then track how long it actually takes.  So I think this hour by hour planner will be a good tool...if I can find a fun way to use it that will keep me coming back.

I've never been in a relationship. I have a good job and am of average, decent looks. Nothing suggests I shouldn't be able to find one.

But I have always struggled with the opposite sex. And I am wondering if it has something to do with this diagnosis.

I feel like the punishment of dating is so much higher than the reward. I feel like all the mistakes I make are just piling up into an ever growing snowball of self hatred, shame and trauma. But I still keep going, and am at this point completely obsessed. I don't do anything unless I believe it is bringing me one step closer to that one thing, which is by default an uncontrollable endeavor.

I have given up on all my previous interests in order to chase the dream of being normal, which to me means being able to find a relationship. And after so much time not doing anything else but chasing that thing, getting into my previous interests feels like starting a hobby completely from scratch. There is just no interest there anymore, in fact there is just a resistance towards them. I hate the thought of picking up my guitar for example. Because I stopped nurturing that interest years ago.

I just curious if this is normal with stimulant medication when sick? Or if my medication is just not working for me anymore. Currently on Adderall 20mg XR with a 10mg IR booster, and I‚Äôve had a sinus infection for months now. 

Backstory: I learned about the sinus infection while I was trying Strattera. The only symptom I had was pressure when lying back or bending forward, a weird taste in my mouth, and sensitivity in my tooth. I actually thought something was wrong with my tooth, so I went to the dentist and they‚Äôre the ones who discovered the sinus infection. No congestion or runny nose, besides my normal, slightly runny nose. I do have an allergy to dust mites, but I don‚Äôt take anything for it, and though it‚Äôs never been confirmed, my husband is sure I have a deviated septum. I was tested 10 years ago for allergies (only the dust mite was positive), and was actually recently tested for dog, since I have two large dogs, but it was negative. Not long after discovering the sinus infection, I switched to the Adderall. I had also just finished a course of antibiotics for the sinus infection, and the taste in my mouth and pressure did seem to improve, and the medication actually really helped me for a couple months! But, a few weeks ago, the sinus infection came back, I was put on more antibiotics and prednisone, and since then, it‚Äôs like the medication does nothing. I‚Äôm also walking around exhausted, like I‚Äôm in a fog all day long. Not sure if that‚Äôs due to the sinus infection, meds not working anymore, or something else.

Just curious if anyone else has dealt with this, since my doctors can‚Äôt really give me a definite answer. Could my meds just not be working?

My mom is suspected to have ADHD, my brother(M31) and I are diagnosed with ADHD-H/I , and we suspect my sister also has ADHD but she hasn't been tested.

My mom got a report back from the school detailing my sister is two grades behind in her math and one grade behind in reading and writing. COVID probably has something to do with it. She also does not remember to do her homework until late at night and she can take hours of procrastinating with anything and just being ""stuck"" to do 5-10 problems. She also is getting severely frustrated (literally pounding her head) while doing homework. We are getting really concerned with the amount of pressure being put on her and if she has ADHD. Not learning along with the other kids can't be painted as her fault and something she needs to fix but at the same time, I think she needs a tutor to help strength her foundational math skills like long addition/subtraction, long multiplication, long division, and PEMDAS. If she has a rock solid foundation, building of of that in school won't be as hard. Does anyone agree with that?

My mom is not reliable to remember to tell her to do her homework. She forgets just as much as my sister does and my mom admits she has no idea how to teach someone time management or organization when she has no time management or organization skills herself.

My brother and I had similar upbringings. I was never getting my homework done on time and I still don't know how to do long division. I graduated engineering school with all D's in math. I don't think it has to be this way for her.

I'm 33yo male. Diagnosed in June. I've been on Elvanse since then, up to 60mg in the morning + 2 x 5mg Dexamfetamine top ups for the afternoon.  
  
I've had substance misuse problems in the past but at 26 I changed my lifestyle and had a bit of a breakdown. I guess I was self medicating. I have always had severe anxiety, but throughout my life people have always said how laid back I am and it's always baffled me. After my breakdown I was put on Duloxetine long term and it did help a bit with the anxiety.  
  
I have always struggled with motivation, getting up in the morning, studying etc. Paying attention when i'm being spoken to etc. You all know the drill. Anyway, starting the Elvanse was a game changer, it's been a massive help with motivation and mood. I could actually think coherently for once in my life and have what I assume is a normal inner monologue.  
  
However, lately I've been noticing my symptoms returning, I've been getting much less clarity, back to thinking 3 things at once, random words/phrases stuck in my head on repeat, obsessing over things. I'm also going through a very difficult period in my marriage and I'm really not sure what way it will go. My wife is not supportive with my ADHD.  
  
I don't know if I need to up my medication, change medication, reduce stress or a combination of these things. I have a review with psychiatrist at the end of the month and I am trying to get my thoughts together. The only way I can describe it is that my mind is getting foggier or more crowded?

I get caught up in hyperfocusing on small things sometimes, but that's much more manageable than losing focus from what I should do multiple times and then hyperfocusing on something irrelevant for a couple of hours.

I'm in university again after taking some time off work. That means I'm pretty flexible how, when and where I do my daily business.

This was already like that without medication, so how do you organise that routine to cook, eat and clean afterwards every day?

So my girlfriend will most likely get her ADHD diagnosis tomorrow. She is 22. It never seemed like she suffered because of it, but two years ago, she lost her job and struggled to find a new one. Now every small problem in life gives her severe anxiety and she just distracts herself. She really want to get over it and find a job again - but she just can't. She already had one visit at the doctor and the result was that she most likely has ADHD. Tomorrow we'll know for sure. I'm trying my very best to help her. But since i have to pay all bills alone for over a year now, it also gets on my nerves. Luckily, she is very determined to fix this with the help of the doctor - and hopefully meds.


And there it is: The meds. I heard some things about them, that they help very well for example. What can i expect? Do the meds change her? Will there be side effects? Does she have to take it forever? It seems like she only really suffers when her life is stressfull and unorganized.

I've been suffering ADD my whole life (with hyperactivity elements), but only recently I was desperate enough to go and get diagnosed. It's official, I got it. And I can strongly say it has ruined my life in more ways than one. I know a lot about a lot, but I can't apply it. I hop from job to job and idea to idea, unable to accomplish anything.

I see a way out, if I get the correct treatment. I've tried everything else, systems, behavior therapies and so on. Nothing works. Can't fix low dopamine with ""strong will"".

Unfortunately in Bulgaria it's virtually impossible to get Ritalin/Concerta as an adult, let alone Adderall and other variants. I was given Strattera which had a mild positive effect initially, but then destroyed my sleep and gave me 120 pulse rate, high blood pressure and persistent constipation. It was of no use.

What can I do, anyone has an idea? In EU, Concerta/Ritalin is widely prescribed, but in Italy and Bulgaria there's a widespread bias against it, and psychiatrists keep telling me it's ""illegal"" for me to get prescribed Concerta.

I'm highly hesitant to order online, because I have no clue what garbage I'll get. But I'm desperate for relief, and to be able to do my work. I don't want to be ""happy"" or to feel a ""high"". All I want is to be able to consistently do my work.

637,17677vv,t3_17677vv,cedarmarsh,Adult w/ADHD recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder,"Hello fellow wondering humans,

My life has been a symphony of ADHD behavior, mostly maladaptive. I could certainly be called a chronic underachiever and have struggled with regulating my emotions especially in the face of perceived rejection (RSD anyone?).  

The relationship between my wife and I has become so strained that we are no longer living under the same roof. The pressures of life as a middle aged adult managing career, teenage kids rapidly moving into adulthood, parents rapidly moving into the grave and living in a greater world that is in upheaval have taken their toll.

Though I have been in and out of counseling, therapy, coaching and all kinds of other interventions throughout most of my life I was compelled to reach out to a mental health professional yet again. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I certainly have grown weary of clinicians and all the best intentions of the mental health community. That said,  I am  so weary from my day-to-day that there seems no better path but back up the same steep mountain of therapy and constant personal monitoring. 

My new therapist seems competent and genuinely interested in my wellbeing. After my intake interview I was told that it seems very likely that I have  borderline personality disorder. As with the symptoms in the DSM for ADHD, I check nearly every box for BPD, there seems little doubt that this particular disorder is very much a part of my daily life. I am not sure what to do with this information, I feel more lost than ever, as if something even close to resembling a normal life is a distant to me as the moon. 

Has anyone else been diagnosed with BPD as well? How did the treatment go? Were you ever able to find some relief from the feeling of disconnection?

Then, she either breaks down in uncontrollable crying or completely freezes.  Sometimes it‚Äôs both.  She can‚Äôt talk at all when this happens.  She has to be led to a quiet place to calm down.

My son was administered a WISC-V (Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children) test and scored 132 on the General Ability Index (which I believe is similar to an IQ score).  He was 6 yrs old at the time, and really struggled with inattentiveness, impatience, hypermobility etc, i.e. the classic ADHD symptoms.  More recently, aged 7, he was diagnosed with ADHD.   He is now on methylphenidate, and since taking methylphenidate my son's concentration has really improved and his schoolwork got a lot better.  It seems like mentally, he's a lot stronger when he's on the meds.  Does this mean that the 132 intelligence score he got before the ADHD meds potentially *under*counts his intelligence?  I.e. if he was put on ADHD meds before taking the intelligence test, could he have scored even higher in that test?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1764vqa/adhd_and_intelligence_tests/,True,2023-10-12 11:38:44,False,2,False,False,1,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/1764vqa/adhd_and_intelligence_tests/

And then it got me thinking about how much more carefree I was when I was little. If it matters my psychiatrist thinks I have autistic tendencies which I learned to mask, I'm currently trying to get assessed.

But I remember so many instances where I would do/say something others found strange and told me to stop. So I stopped sharing and completely closed off to other people because I was afraid of doing something annoying/weird.

I have a partner and with him I am more myself than I can be with anyone else, but I still know I hold back certain things, for example talking about stuff I am currently hyperfixating on. I am afraid I'll annoy him, because I know some things can be draining, like listening to someone talking nonstop about a topic. But on the other hand he is the person I want to live the rest of my life with and I want to share my thoughts with him!
But I know if I would just get a hint of disintrest/annoyance I would again shut off completely and never share anything with him because of my past experiences. It just hurts me to the core when I feel like someone isn't as interested in my hyperfixation like I am, and I know how unrealistic this is. This whole hyperfixation is just one example I could think of at the moment.

656,1763t5t,t3_1763t5t,revolutionarat,How to not get scared at the thought of driving?,"I got my driving license three years ago and have barely driven since. 

For context: I got my license in Germany, it cost about 2k euros (it's really expensive here). When I was in driving school I drove very well, the only problem I had was all the rules but having my teacher next to me helped. Then I went to my first practical exam and failed because I didn't see a street sign and went into the wrong street and failed. It really had a toll on me mentally, I failed like a failure. My teacher was disappointed because he said I usually drove very well. I tried again two weeks later and passed the exam, I was even told I drove very well. But since then, I'm scared of driving. 

I don't have my own car (it's not practical because I live in a big city and public transport is just more comfortable than finding parking spots and I don't even have a space in front of my apartment to park my car) but when I'm at my parents I can use my dad's car. The only route I have driven a lot is a 4 minute drive from the station to my parents home, this is the only route I'm comfortable with. I tried driving outside of my parents town twice but I always cried because of how scared I got.

It's just there are so many rules and I'm scared that I can't remember all. I'm also scared of straight up killing someone or myself because I'm not attentive and can't react very fast. For example yesterday a motorcycle went infront of our car out of nowhere while my father was driving and he hit the breaks very quick and we didn't collide but I feel like I would have hit the motor cycle. I feel bad because we spent so much money on my license and we only got it because my father was the only one with a license and we wanted to take some work off of him.

I researched about it for quite a long time and most of the symptoms/behaviours are present since I was a child, so I decided to seek the help of a psychologist to find out if I really have it.

So he believes I have some form of obssessive behaviour with routines and organization and that I don't seem to have any form of ADHD...which I disagree because there are too many blatant behaviours that are not explained by this obssessivity.

Of course everybody says that everyone has some form of behaviour like mine. Ok! But it's not something constant. While others say I want to be diagnosed with ADHD because of sympathy to my former gf (we broke up 3 weeks ago), and it's not.

At the end of July, I finally  made an appointment with a doctor I‚Äôd seen a couple times before and discussed some other issues and then brought up that I thought I‚Äôd been struggling with ADHD. I fill out and GAD/depression questionnaire (which she didn‚Äôt even read), and she offers Wellbutrin which I declined at the time, and she sets up an appt with psychiatry hesitantly. I find out I have to wait over two months to get in, I take the original doctor up on her Wellbutrin in the mean time.  I wait, appt gets cancelled a week before because guess what, the doctors not coming in on that day now! So they move me to telemedicine.

The fact I made it this far is a huge accomplishment for me. I had the appt a few days ago, and again, this doctor completely shrugs off my ADHD concerns. He focuses solely on my anxiety and prescribes me buspirone, despite my pleas of how hard it is for me to focus on getting anything done. I tell him my house is in shambles, my temper and sensory overload is through the roof, I can hardly get any adulting done to save my life. I want a clean home and an organized life more than anything. But he thinks that I‚Äôm just anxious about how much there is to do. And I am anxious.

I've been looking for a new job and like every other time i've been in this position, i don't know what that should be, i'm just not sure i want to do *this* anymore.

Since ADHD is complicated and by no means is a one size fits all kind of thing, i thought it would be best to just make a post about myself and hope you'd give some recommendations.

I'm a M30 with an IT technology education that gives a broad but not very deep introduction to the IT world; networking, programming, IT security, Embedded systems, project management and probably some other stuff i forgot. I finished the education this February and has since been working as a network technician.

My biggest challenge is by far my learning ability. I don't think i have more problems than the next with learning new stuff, it's *recalling* that new stuff that's hard. That could be for a test, in a meeting where i am asked something directly or in a situation where i need to act fast. i need information to be new or often used, to recall it fast. (If anybody got a fix for this, please comment it, lol)

Other traits/properties:

* I am very visually dependent, especially when it comes to understanding things. If i can't see it in my head, i don't understand it. However, if i can, not only do i uderstand it, i tend to be able to describe it to a colleague as well as a leader or even my mom.
* I love cleaning and tidying up, physically or virtually. I love structure and if there isn't any struture, i strive to make some.
* I usually focus on the person in a task, if possible. That could be a colleague, a customer or a leader. I'm very good at putting myself in their shoes and think ""what do they get out of it?"" I also get motivated by helping people and changing their day for the better.
* I like multitasking, changing between different tasks and a high pace.
* I work best when i have a clear idea of what is expected.

I was on a 'go slow'. I was in a daze a lot of the time but I found I was quite sharp. My mind was clearer the more tired I was. The one day, a day before I got really ill with the flu, I went out and did an escape room. First we played this overly complicated game that usually I would never in a million years have grasped the rules. Instead, I was understanding them as my friend told me. It's like the tireder I was the more able I was to actually think about the rules he was telling me, rather than be distracted by the noises and the lights and my own racing thoughts. 

When we went into the escape room, I was solving things. Usually in these things I'm too overwhelmed by everyone running about trying to figure out clues and with the amount of clues there are. But I was so tired I just stood there, calmly, checking the room and figuring out clues. I performed really well. 

I came down with the flu after that and it's been really bad. I have an interview today, and have done nothing but prepare for it for the past week.

So, after I started with Concerta (18mg), I got a job and stoped to flirt at all, it's been almost 7 months that I don't to go a party and even more that I don't have anything sexually with somebody.

I also stopped to flirt with a great friend of mine who I think I'm in love with since before I broke up with my ex. It's not like a absence of libido, but more the lack of will to do something about it, I don't know if that makes sense.

With everything said, my doctor increased my medication to 36mg. It was terrible, anxiety, depression and no will to live. 

Long time short, he decided to let me have a break with the medication for a little time before I go back to my usual 18mg dose.

Ignore something for so long/completely tune it out until when it starts getting uncomfortably noticeable you have a meltdown. 

Okay so typically, I'm one to do this a lot. I don't like having meltdowns because I live with my family and living with family = extreme masking. But sometimes meltdowns are so inevitable.

Can ADHD kind of get more 'prominent' as you age? I'm a 16 yr old girl and I've started acknowledging that ADHD may be a thing for me ever since I was 14. 

For a long time, I had no issues despite always daydreaming in class and missing instruction. But now, I'm nearing the end of high school where things get a bit more tedious and all the methods I once used to ""catch up"" are getting more difficult to use. It's like walking through a sandy desert, you got water for the most part but then it runs out and suddenly you feel yourself sinking into quicksand.

Just very recently, as I started to conclude that the reasom why Im the way I am might just be cus of ADHD, I started seeing slight behavioral changes in me.

Before I was able to sit still because of fear of what others would think of me.

Do the U.S. ADA protections against discrimination for ADHD extend to the communication and emotional symptoms of the illness?  
I ask because all of the typical ADA accomodation recommendations for ADHD are actually in place at my current job just as standard operating proceedures. In fact they have been my last 3 jobs.  
But my inability to communicate in a way that people understand what I'm trying to say, my very direct, blunt speach, and my emotional reactions to feeling wronged, particularly combined with the other two issues, are my primary issues at work right now.  
I've literally been held back because of it, denied promotions and raises, and made fun of by company execs.  
These struggles are why I went to a psychiatrist in the first place, because I just couldn't seem to change on my own. My ADHD diagnosis came out of that.  
Shortly after my diagnosis, I basically took another demotion, again as a direct result of the way I talk and my emotional reactions.  
I ""kind of"" lost it.  
My old boss and new boss both wanted to talk about my ""feelings on the change"". They refused to give me time to gather myself to where I could control myself, despite my specific request due to the ADHD.

I felt like on was on 5 cups of coffee, heart felt like it was beating out of my chest. Got Covid and increased to 30mg. These two weeks were a bit of a wash as  I was really sick and drinking a ton of coffee just to remain upright. 

In the first month I've found my motivation to just do things without procrastinating to be very high! However, my ability to stay focused was all over the place, worse then before I was medicated.

I moved uo to 40 mg today and no coffee. Way less energy, I pretty much crashed by early afternoon. I haven't been able to focus on anything. Also deeply depressed today. Upside was that my heart wasnt racing all day.

I have had headaches for most of the month which I thought was from coffee withdrawal or Covid but am worried about it as side effect of the Vyvanse.

708,175t4tp,t3_175t4tp,skeletonqueen,Medication: How Do I Know it's Working?,"Forgive the slightly clickbait-y title. 

For context, a doctor diagnosed me with ADHD when I was eight (so around seventeen years ago)  and I've been taking stimulants pretty much every day (with some more recent exceptions) ever since. On my first day of taking Focalin, I didn't feel different at all, but later found out my teachers called my parents that day to say I was a completely different student at school that day.  Since then I've found Focalin to mostly feel like a very good cup of a caffeinated beverage, but sometimes not much of anything. I have had side-effects from it.

Fast forward to this year and the DEA's mess starts effecting my ability to get Focalin. I have a rough couple of months where I don't take any stimulants at all, but I don't feel overly different, things are just harder and I slip more often. My psychiatrist recommends I switch to Cotempla, says it's very similar to Focalin. Well, I've been on Cotempla for a few weeks now, and if anything, I think things have gotten worse. Work is very hard to be present for, I'm making more careless mistakes than usual, and I'm very sleepy more often than not despite getting a ton of sleep every night (though I had issues with fatigue while on Focalin as well). But again, I don't necessarily feel different. Wondering if there are ways to gauge the efficacy of a medication in situations like this?  


TL;DR: I was on Focalin for sixteen years and didn't feel particularly different on or off of it. This year I had to switch to a new medication and I suspect it's not working, but I feel about the same so I'm not sure.

710,175t0ey,t3_175t0ey,Lintaar,Unmedicated: How to Become a Hard Worker?,"(22M). I love working, in fact I've never had a job I didn't love. Even working at McDonald's I had a great time. Now I work in tech and my job has more responsibilities, but I love the work. The problem is that I really only have short bursts of productivity (which are normally hours but occasionally last days). I get insane amounts of work done when I'm productive, and I *know* I get dopamine from it because those moments of hyper-productivity and focus are some of the best of my life. 

I feel so lazy all the time. I know I will enjoy work, but actually getting into it is so incredibly difficult. My job performance has started to slack a lot because of this, or at very best confuse management greatly as to why I will finish a project a month ahead of schedule and then struggle to do small things.

711,175sxkx,t3_175sxkx,cheezybri4,A better way to think about Dopamine,"The way I have always heard dopamine described is as a 'happy chemical' a 'reward system' or a 'pleasure transmitter'. I think this is the wrong way to think about the role of dopamine when trying to get your head round it. 

Therefore I offer an alternative:
Dopamine, the cooling system. All computers, whether liquid or fan cooled, are cooled as they run. The processors generate alot of heat, slowing them down, and the cooling system keeps it running at an optimal temperature, fast and efficient. But what if your cooling liquid was insufficient, or your fan was too slow? What then? Well your computer would keep kicking, running programs as it slowly cooks itself, getting hotter and hotter with every function, and slower and slower as the heat begins to stress it. Eventually, for the sake of the computer, you're gonna have to stop what you're doing, take a break and let it cool off. You wanna get it fixed but there's a year long waiting list at your repair shop, you may not have the money, and even then the repair might be unsuccessful, so you keep using it, taking breaks when it gets too hot, and trying to cram all your work or gaming into short sessions as to still get it done. Eventually, you may even learn to live with it. Sure its a pain but you know If you clear your tabs you can keep it going longer, and you're used to the timing, you know how quickly it gets hot. Anyone else who used it would be sooooo frustrated and confused, but you know what you're doing, don't you. You have strategies and you've learned how to cope. It's just the way it is, but you'll manage.

Dopamine is like a cooling system, and it's meant to keep you feeling fresh and focused. Don't let yourselves overheat :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/175sxkx/a_better_way_to_think_about_dopamine/,True,2023-10-12 00:00:15,2023-10-12 00:04:37,2,False,False,2,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/175sxkx/a_better_way_to_think_about_dopamine/

For example, if my partner submits the report to college for disability accommodation or shares it with their PCP, who will manage the medication if needed,will reports come from non psycharisit and non psychologist be doubted normally?

I suspected something was up my entire childhood, but was instead called lazy by my parents and family when it came to completing schoolwork and other tasks (you all know how it goes). After my diagnosis I was prescribed a dose of Adderall IR that was 10mg, I was meant to take it twice per day. The first day I felt the classic ""euphoria"" and ""calm"" that comes with it and also the ability to focus and do tasks, which was amazing in terms of my productivity, after a few weeks it felt as if the drugs effects were wearing off, and I'm not referring to that ""euphoria"", I'm referring to my ability to focus on one task and do so calmly and unaccompanied by unnecessary emotion. 

So in response, my provider said that we should titrate up to 20mg and not waste time going to 15mg. His rationale was that nearly 80% of his patients were performing their best and responding well to 20mg, and in the event that I had reacted negatively, we could just lessen the dose, easy. So as I took the 20mg and felt no effects for the first two weeks,  which i was suprised by, I hit up my provider once again and now i am at 25 mg. The great thing is the major side effects are gone (dry mouth and low apetite) but I'm left with a dull headache and jitteriness each time I take the meds, I have more energy but it's like I'm struggling to direct that energy toward a task, and because of that the calm is gone.

729,175q2kb,t3_175q2kb,MoroseApostrophe,Seeking tips for moderating my spazmocitude around my autistic son.,"Hello all, 41m ADHD experiencer. My son is 6, and low-support autistic, also probably ADHD, but the doctors have suggested holding off a bit longer before giving a more detailed diagnosis, as some of his issues may be due to being premature/having a speech impediment/getting undersocialized due to the pandemic.

I'm rarely fully engaged enough in something to sit still. I was diagnosed as ADD in the 90s, and their solution was to keep upping my Ritalin dosage until it reached levels that I half-think I'm misremembering, because I recently got licensed as a pharmacy technician and the recommended daily dosages are much lower than I took with every meal (learning all the restrictions they've added since I was on it was a real eye-opener). Point being that I'm not on any medication right now, and have a strong aversion to the thought of taking any. Part of how I deal is the aforementioned spazmocitude. I jitter, I jiggle, I jive, I tap things, I chant in vaguely sci-fi sounding gibberish. It helps me focus, a little, and at my highest saturations of spazmoplasticity I can hardly go 30 seconds without at least muttering and drumming.

The problem is that it upsets my son. He doesn't like lots of intrusive random noises, and Intrusive Random Noises is the middle name that I've struggled to fit into every form and job application I've ever filled out. I try to curb it around him, but a minute later I forget, and I'm sounding off and he's shouting that I'm ""distracolating"" him. I've tried moving further away from him, but I like spending time with him, and by the time I'm enough rooms away that he can't hear me distracolating, I'm far enough that I can't hear him tipping all the silverware out the bedroom window.

For instance I felt more of the effects of the IR about two hours after I took it. I know for some people sometimes they just need to find a new combo or way to take it for it to work again as their body chemistry changes as they age. So, I‚Äôm asking what works best for you in terms of adderall (esp those who developed a tolerance but figured out a new regiment that works)? Do you take ER and IR later? Do you just take IR multiple times throughout the day? (That may br my next attempt if my psych doesn‚Äôt get annoyed with me) let it br known if I take adderall too late in the day it gives me worse insomnia than I already have. I just want to know what you guys do to make adderall work most effectively for you. Increasing my dosage will likely be the next step but like I said that usually only helps for a day or so and it‚Äôs like my body gets used to it. I don‚Äôt wanna believe I developed a permanent intolerance bc it still works sometimes.

I'm looking for input from anyone that has both, or a parent that has a child with both. My son was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago, but has since had some more extensive testing and has been diagnosed with autism. With having ADHD myself I am comfortable helping him with ADHD related issues, but I must admit I really am not that well versed with autism. I plan to get more educated on it, but I do find personal experiences very helpful trying to grasp new things. 

We have accommodations in place at school right now, but they're all associated with ADHD. We plan on calling an ARD to change the school plan, but tbh I'd love to know some things you have found useful or things you wish in hindsight could have been utilised. 

I talked to the testing dr today, so I don't have the full report yet. From my understanding he would be somewhere in the high functioning side - apologies if that's not a correct way of phrasing that. 

This information is all new right now, so maybe I'll have some more specific questions, but I'd be grateful for any insight into how it is having ADHD/autism.

744,175k4bm,t3_175k4bm,Hamblerger,Angry over realizing how much being taken off of Ritalin as a child affected my life,"Was washing dishes a couple of weeks ago and thinking of how much better my life was now that I've been on my meds for a while. Then it hit me: I actually had an ADHD (ADD at the time) diagnosis when I was 12, and was given Ritalin. It worked. I showed improvement. My mother took me off of it after about a year and a half. This led to my grades cratering again, and my behavior getting out of hand. This got worse by the year until I was finally kicked out of the house due to my seeming refusal to get a job, and my obvious inability to keep one when I did bother looking.

This led to twenty-five years on and off (mostly on) the streets. To give some sense of what that was like, when I tried to give a concise rundown of it, the post was auto-removed for length. And that was just the major points. The psychological impact of that is indescribable, and not something that I am likely to ever fully process in my life.

And the thing is, it was all so unnecessary. I don't know why she took me off of the medication (She alternately said that she thought that it was overprescribed at the time and that I just needed more structure, that I did need it once but stopped needing it later, and that she didn't see it doing any good, none of which made sense).

I am angry. Not just that she kicked me out, but that she took me off of the medication that caused my ADHD to run wild, leading to my not having the tools to actually function in life, and then called it a character issue and kicked me out rather than seeing how badly I was in need of treatment.

And worst of all, she died over twenty years ago, and I am just now coming to terms with this aspect of our relationship. I can't talk to her about it. I can't confront her. I want to sit with her and ask her non-judgmentally why she did this, and for each of us to try to make amends for how we hurt each other. But I don't know if she'd agree that she played even a small part in all this, and I never will. I get therapy instead, and the opportunity to tell this to a bunch of folks here who might relate.

I have always suffered from ADHD. Since childhood, I never ever paid attention to any classes ever, not even in my fav subject. As a kid(and to some degree even today) my fav way to escape from the boring lectures or study times was to imagine huge stories filled with detail or ideas for the next GTA game complete with missions and complex storylines. I also sometimes designed my own web series in my mind with dialogues and imaginary theme songs and stuff. My rough book was filled with weird stories, unfinished plans, poems, lyrics for songs, engineering diagrams that don't make sense and cartoons. I would sing randomly when studying or start doing some other activity. Basically I just wasn't there when people taught me stuff and I was somewhere else. Same for when I sat down to finish homework after school/assignments after college. I hated them because they were a toil I was forced to do.  
  
I always did ok-ish in exams right from first grade to my engineering bachelors but struggled quite hard sometimes and almost always performed below my expectations resulting in constant feeling of failure and defeat. Thats why I hate exams atleast in my country because even scientific subjects are all about mugging up a 100 formulas(yes 100) and applying them in mindless sums. I hated homework, I hated classes and I hated exams.  
  
Despite all this, I have noticed that I have constantly improved as the years went by and in fact now my Mtech has been completed with great scores and 3 publications and landed good opportunity too. I am completely satisfied and happy with the results. In fact, in the last 5 years I have come to know of my ADHD and went to radical means to fight it like closing the curtains all day so my attention doesn't go awery or slapping myself if I look away or pretending that every task at hand is a soldierly duty with the nation at stake.  
  
One thing about me is that I am a fanatic when it comes to doing tasks that matter like the research project in my Mtech or completing a very tough job at the company. I do not eat, sleep or do anything until the job is finished and done with and I can only truly be happy when I am completely free from any pesky work. Until then I spend as much time in the day possible to finish that work(with good result of course) and feel the sense of achievement and completion when I finish it.  
  
lastly I am also an amateur content creator  
  
Also note that the stuff in paragraph 1 still happens but now I have an awareness that I am not made for this earth so I treat myself harshly to curb it all.  
  
  
so have any of you managed to maintain attention through certain means?

It is not always this hard, but right now I am in a huge mega crisis and it is so bad that i have tried online therapy from a well known (and dubious?) online therapy provider, and on the mention of anxiety and concentration issues my ""therapist"" told me there is no such thing as all of these ""disorders"" and that I just need to get my shit together, lol. That's when I finally decided to seek an evaluation. Wish me luck that I get some answers, whatever they may be. The preliminary diagnosis of ADHD really really surprised me.

I currently work from home and do all my work for the day in a 1-2 hr super concentrated window but besides that I am a mess (not currently medicated). 

I am really debating getting medicated if I dont get the job as I think it would help with some structure in my current job, and at the same time I want to wait a bit if I do get the job as I want to see if this new environment would better manage by ADHD, but this period of limbo is making me so anxious.

Right now, I take a 5mg quick release every morning between 6:30 and 7:00, and then another around 2:00. I space them out like that because I've found that if I overlap them too much I am very out of it, and if I take it any later than 2 or 2:30 I'll get crap sleep.

So far, my experience has been that half the time it does help. I remember things more easily and I'm much more likely to follow through with tasks than before.

Today, I visited a psychiatrist for the first time. I listed my symptoms, and when I finished, he told me I don't have ADHD because I was focused on talking to him, where my symptoms should be exacerbated by stress. He also mentioned that since I completed school and I'm now in college, it means I'm coping well and can't have ADHD. Then, he started describing how ADHD works, and I felt like he was talking about me.

Another argument against my ADHD was that during my school years, I was a shy child. He claimed that kids with ADHD have many friends because they're funny, and other kids want to hang out with them. He also mentioned that if I wold have adhd I wold not be able to read books at all, when I told him that I enjoyed reading but sometimes I had to go back after reading few pages because I was forgetting what I was reading about.

781,175k49i,t3_175k49i,No-Maximum1892,Any tips for super scatterbrained verbal processors?,"I have ADHD and I am severely scatterbrained all the time, and I often feel like I have to either write (not as accessible) or talk things out (even to myself) to process and make more organized sense of my billions of scattered thoughts. I'll often find myself trying so hard not to talk to myself or mouth things to myself when I'm walking home from work, or sometimes I'll start recording myself just to I have an excuse to say things out loud lmao. So when I say I'm a verbal processor, I'm a HUGE verbal processor.

But because I'm so scatterbrained, it often takes me a MINUTE to get to a point in my thoughts where I can make organized, clear, concise sense of them. I have recorded videos of myself processing everyday things that ended up being over an hour long. This has also always been apparent in my academic & professional writing, too, where I'll always catch myself writing WAY past the word limit and I have to spend \*so\* long cutting everything back afterwards. It's not that it takes me a long time to understand things per se, but I tend to want to explore and understand things to the Nth degree from all different angles and it takes me a long time to do all of that and then simplify it all down to something I can easily and confidently explain or remember in the future, if that makes sense.

And, unfortunately, because I don't always have the ability to get my thoughts out and process them before talking to other people, I often end up communicating my thoughts out loud in scattered, rambly, confusing ways to others. If I'm talking to my friends or my partner, I'm not as insecure about this, but it really makes me insecure when I'm at work. If I let more of my thoughts be heard out loud, I tend to confuse and potentially irritate people by going in circles, skipping around between issues, or talking about side-issues that help with my own processing but are totally irrelevant to them. But if I try to hold myself back from talking too much and control myself more before fully processing, I tend to have a hard time confidently figuring out the best way to concisely explain myself, and I end up taking a noticeably long time to pick the right words to talk about something that's ultimately super simple. Either way, I end up looking less confident and less intelligent, and I've had multiple issues where this prevented other people from being able to understand me clearly.

But also, when I did exercises in grad school that required me to argue with a panel and then answer questions afterward, I was told that I came off much better when I was answering questions off-the-cuff than when I was arguing my heavily scripted argument that was intended to ensure I was concise and effective.

Trouble is most, if not all of the other kids were not. Mental health awareness was practically non-existent in the 90s. Why do you take longer?

I‚Äôm a 43yo wife & mother. My husbands parents invested heavily & very early on in my 21 & 19 year old son & daughter‚Äôs college education, but the funds now exceed what they need, so my in laws have encouraged me to use the leftover college funds to further my own education-which has been embarrassingly limited.

I was raised by 2 very young, VERY ‚Äúborn again‚Äù, former hippies, who expressed great disdain towards higher learning/education, & frowned upon wife/mothers with careers. 
I‚Äôm 43 now but wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with ADHD(innatentive type)until I was 31, so from 5th grade on(cuz that‚Äôs when sh#* gets real;), school really was a nightmare for me.
To make matters worse, I was homeschooled for the majority of those years, so I never really graduated-officially.

So here‚Äôs my actual question. When I think of ‚Äúeducating‚Äù myself in any number of areas, I genuinely feel excited-I love to read & learn about many things on my own time, and aside from math, I‚Äôm sometimes able to see myself as an intelligent person. But the second I remember that my ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù & ultimate graduation will be contingent upon obtaining a GED(another test!),as well as my performance on tests, that spark of excitement is immediately replaced with a deep sense of fear, panic & foreboding‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs FREE education!

However, before I became aware of my ADHD, I had a different experience. I didn't feel bored with unengaging events/things; instead, I would either zone out and think about other things, or enter a sort of non-responsive state where I wouldn't think about much at all. This was my way of coping with activities that failed to capture my attention.  
Upon reflection, I realized that I wasn't ""never bored"" as I initially thought, but more likely ""always bored"" to some extent. This boredom just manifested differently for me. Instead of feeling the mundane drag of disinterest, my mind would either wander or shut down as a defense mechanism against unengaging tasks. What others labeled as boredom, I bypassed by disengaging from the situation entirely.  
I managed to get through school, and had the good fortune of encountering a highly engaging teachers and professors who made learning and working enjoyable. These interactions were pivotal in keeping me motivated during my high school years and graduate studies, even before I had a full grasp on my ADHD condition.  
I am sharing this personal insight to see if others have had a similar experience. It took a deep dive into understanding my ADHD to realize that my perception of boredom was skewed, and that my coping mechanisms were automatic responses to a lack of engagement.

He told me he needs one day to clean everything because if he doesn‚Äôt dedicate a whole day, he can‚Äôt do it, but that just means we have to live in a mess for the rest of the 6 days. 

I asked if he could at least do the minimum, like instead of leaving clothes on the floor, put it in the washing basket. Once he‚Äôs finished eating, put the dishes in the dishwasher instead of on the kitchen side. If he notices a wash has finished it‚Äôs cycle (you actually have to go to it to turn it off or it keeps beeping), just chuck the stuff in the dryer.

I‚Äôve been on Vyvanse since I was 8 years old (late 2000s) (70mg daily now)and intermittently took adderall in afternoons (20mg IR) until I graduated college - having ADHD and trying to work with it is nothing new to me. I‚Äôve always known it affected my grades, my schoolwork, i.e. I‚Äôd do my homework but forget to put it in my backpack or submit it. But at least in the context of school, I was able to work around it - even with ADHD, I‚Äôve been quite successful school/career wise - and I think that led me to believe that it wasn‚Äôt as big of a deal as people said.

Now that I‚Äôm several years into being an adult‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm beginning to realize how deeply adhd affects me.

- I‚Äôm literally incapable of packing for trips until the last second. I will procrastinate all night and literally pull a fucking all nighter to avoid spending 10 minutes packing my suite case until I need to leave for the airport (which I‚Äôm doing right now please help)
- awful at doing dishes (I‚Äôll just do it in 5 minutes, yknow)
- grocery list? Forget it lol. 70% of the food I buy ends up expired and thrown out cuz I can‚Äôt plan for shit or damn, that fruit looks good but I can‚Äôt find the motivation to wash it.
- I haven‚Äôt lived in the state I‚Äôm a primary resident of for 6 years. Paying double state taxes because of it, but still can‚Äôt seem to make myself fix it and change residencies. RIP‚Ä¶ $5k? $10k? Idk, I can‚Äôt keep track of money.
- I‚Äôm the number one message sender at my 5000+ employee company in slack because every sentence I send is spread across 5 messages because my brain just moves that fast
- I‚Äôm incapable of portion control. If I have food in my kitchen, and I crave it, I will eat the entire pack, even though I desperately want nothing more to be healthier and am constantly beating myself up over it
- I accidentally paid for double healthcare coverage because I couldn‚Äôt manage to waive the college healthcare thing due to lack of motivation. RIP $3500.

I‚Äôm not asking for solutions (although always open to it) - but it sure as hell is vindicating having just discovered this sub and realizing that I‚Äôm not just a lazy bum, and maybe all of these issues I have are actually related to my medical condition.

The clinicians I work with hold a lot of stigmatized views about ADHD, claiming things like ADHD is never an excuse and that ADHD medication is the worst thing ever. I can understand their concern given the age but it's difficult when you see that at least in the foster care system many of these children have ADHD likely due to a familial history/generational trauma causing genetic changes.    

They don't understand that therapy will not work as effectively for a child with ADHD and is not medicated. They do not understand that ADHD is not a trauma response or a behaviors. They do not understand that is a neurodevelopmental disorder.   

We are just continuing inter-generational failure with the inability to provide ADHD services at a reasonable effective and affordable rate. It's nearly impossible to get ongoing services for adults as it is.   

I know that they judge me for it; advocating and fighting the stigma while facing my own challenges with ADHD. Like they don't want to get too close to me. How ironic, since this is exactly why ADHD is so isolating to begin with.

805,175gzw0,t3_175gzw0,Amazing_Data_9168,Advice needed,"Hi Reddit

I have a general question to the community regarding ADHD/Depression/Bipolarity.
I will try to sum it up as short as possible. Please read it, as it will be a huge help for me.

I have always been a worried person, and always seem to overthink situations. My concentration and attention span is bad in general, but if I‚Äôm interested in something, I have an ability to hyper focus on it (at least until I get bored of it). Mostly, I feel like I have a brain fog and never really care to concentrate.
I‚Äôve always been impulsive, but this behavior seems to worsen if I feel good. I suck with handling money and my mood is usually pretty flat, but a bit on the low end (low motivation and not very talkative, but functioning for sure). That‚Äôs why I like doing adrenaline junky stuff sometimes, because then I feel ‚Äúalive‚Äù.

I was put on SSRI one year ago, and looking back I can tell that it was really stupid. I bought a sports car, spent money I didn‚Äôt have, had some hyper-sexuality, cut my hair and booked trips I couldn‚Äôt afford because I ‚Äúfelt like it‚Äù. 
All this sounds like an SSRI-induced hypomanic episode, right?
Well the thing is, my sleep schedule was perfectly normal and I still felt normal but less anxious. I was generally pretty tired and slept a lot. I was not in any sense happier, just not anxious. I was like this for 7 months, until I stopped taking the medication.

So my question to the community is, do you think I have an underlying ADHD, that is masked by depression symptoms, and when the depression and anxiety lessens, my normal ‚Äúimpulsive self‚Äù comes out? Or may it be because of a BP disorder?

He also told me to take a 2nd and 3rd dose decreasing by 5mg each time (eg. 15 10 5)

I've reread the email with these instructions and I'm not sure if he meant to find my morning dose before adding on the other 2 as I was given 900mg for the month which only averages to 30mg a day.

I've been sticking to the 20-15-10 pattern which still doesn't always work but some days I can function pretty normally.

When you spend your entire life forced to control your thoughts and focus on something, it gets exhausting as we all know.

Therefore allowing yourself time to think, literally just sit (or walk around) and think, nothing else. Wherever your mind goes, let it, and if it jumps from thought to thought every second, that's fine. Don't try to direct or control it, you need to let your mind run free.

It works wonders. After about an hour, you feel so much more refreshed. You can even focus better.

Only thing in the afternoon I would experience a crash where I would yawn like crazy and feel really down. 
This week I have been switched to 10mg extended release to avoid the crash and going up to 20 mg next week. 
I have just found that the extended release are not half as good? My concentration is back to terrible and my head is noisy still. I took 10 mg yesterday and 20 today, just because I have a lot of tasks at work and I still find it rubbish. Will stick to the plan of 10 mg per day for the rest of the week but just wondering has anyone else experienced this? Does it get better over time?

846,175c1av,t3_175c1av,PLTuck,Adult realisation / diagnosis. How did you deal with the anger and frustration?,"Hi,

I'll try and keep it brief. Before 6 months ago it had never crossed my mind that I may have ADHD. Then 6 months ago something happened that led to me wondering about it for the first time in my life. The more I looked into it the more sense my life made. I'm in my 50s. Suddenly my school reports from the '70s and '80s made sense. My recklessness and impulsivity made sense. My sometimes losing my 'filter' made sense.

I spoke to my GP (I'm in the UK) who agreed that my suspicions were probably right and he referred me for assessment. There is a 5 year waiting list for this, which is anger inducing by itself.

But these past few months I've been wondering how my life may have turned out had it been recognised earlier. I'm starting to feel a bit bitter about it and really don't want to feel this way. On a surface level it is what it is and you play the hand you're dealt but I feel like my whole life up until now has been wasted.

Has anyone else felt similarly? And does anyone have any practical tips to get past this anger and bitterness?

I have recently adopted my great grandfather‚Äôs 75 year old desk. It has been sitting in a basement for 25 years, likely as an on and off home for wayward mice. When I moved it, I sprayed and wiped it down with Mr. Clean¬Æ. 

After wiping it down, my brain felt like it had gone into power saving mode. There was a definite decline in cognitive function. 

Fast forward to the two times I‚Äôve used the desk, I am unable to concentrate and think and got very restless.

Has anyone had this happen to them before? Is it the desk? Is it the Mr. Clean¬Æ??? 

I suppose after work I should try just exposing myself to the Mr. Clean to see if it‚Äôs the culprit. Next I can wipe down the desk with cold water and try to remove any weird shit. However, this desk is ancient and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it were made of lead and asbestos.

849,175bh0o,t3_175bh0o,ukrainiansteak1,I wonder how brains of people without ADHD function,"I'm struggling to believe that there are people who don't experience challenges with routine tasks, commitment to jobs, and relationships. Are there really individuals who don't need to intensely focus on something to get tasks done?

I find that I can't even begin my work without first playing a few rounds of Candy Crush, browsing social media, chatting with someone, or watching a YouTube video. I've never been diagnosed with ADHD, mainly because getting a diagnosis is challenging where I live. For a long time, I just assumed my behavior was due to poor discipline. However, when I'm genuinely interested or passionate about something at work, I'm punctual and can manage tasks efficiently. But there are times when I'm deadly bored. My typical work week consists of working intensely for 12-16 hours over 2 days, and then barely doing anything for the rest of the week, despite being present. I also notice I lack consistent positive habits, with most of my actions being spontaneous decisions.

Growing up, I observed similar behavior in my mom, and I mistakenly thought she was simply lazy. I've often been labeled as lazy myself, but I find it hard to believe that someone ""lazy"" can be as dedicated and work as intensively as I do when I'm truly engaged.

I've come across plenty of content online that describes how the minds of people with ADHD work, but I'm curious to read about those without ADHD. I'd love to understand if most people genuinely function differently since my social bubble mostly consists of the people who have similar struggles to mine.

After work take a way home passing by places you can do productive things. For example I take a lot of stairs, long routs looping around where I need to be (exercise). Passing by a library since it would be *silly* not go in there and read/write.

I'm not sure this is the right place to post this, but I really need to talk about my experience and get some feedback. 

I've recently made a significant move to Germany to be with my boyfriend. I'm excited to start this new chapter in my life, but I'm facing some challenges on the job front.

Last year was quite a journey for me. I was diagnosed with ADHD and was managing a new job, a new office, and a team of four, all while recovering from a foot injury. I reached out for help, but my pleas went unanswered, leading to me losing that job. It's a chapter that still weighs on me, and I realise I'm still looking for closure. At the same time I feel there's nothing I can do since the people that overlooked my situation were not inclined to me opening up and rather wanted me to leave the office immediately. So reaching out to clarify doesn't seem to be something that could lead to a productive outcome. I thought about posting my story in linkedin as a statement during the World mental health day, but I don't want to sound like I'm victimising myself. 

One of the biggest challenges I'm facing in Germany is that many job opportunities require proficiency in the German language. I'm actively learning, but I'm not yet fluent. This language barrier is making my job hunt challenging.

Moreover, this experience has influenced my self-esteem, something I already struggle with. I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any advice you might have to offer. How do you think I can find that closure and move forward? And any tips on overcoming self-esteem challenges, especially in a new country? Should I still looking for closure since talking about this is of a limited help? I discussed the topic extensively with friends, with my therapist, boyfriend... nothing seems to put me at peace.

868,1758yl3,t3_1758yl3,Mindless-Gazelle-226,(Help) Seeking a diagnosis in the U.K.,"Hiya all,

I‚Äôm an adult (37) who, after having quite a few debilitating mental issues throughout my adulthood was told by my therapist in 2021 I probably have adhd and to seek a diagnosis. I set the ball rolling through psychiatry-uk and had a telephone appointment lined up for around 6 months later. Long story short I essentially forgot all about the interview by the time it rolled around, I was travelling abroad and I got booted off the waiting list. I did however fill out the self-assessment form which all but confirmed to me I probably do have some pretty moderate form of ADHD.

I‚Äôm now in a place where I find so many of my issues to be debilitating and want to seek help for it, but I‚Äôm worried about the size of waiting lists and how long a diagnosis will take these days. And whether because of such a huge influx of people seeking an ADHD diagnosis whether I‚Äôll even be taken seriously. I find it hard to push myself to do anything I perceive as ‚Äúchorelike‚Äù at the best of times, but the idea of waiting half a decade from this point for a potential diagnosis, let alone any support or treatment, has me kinda feeling ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù and that I might as well just keep muddling through.

I guess my question is does anyone have any real-time idea of how long potential diagnosis would take? Is it even worth it if I‚Äôve all but confirmed for myself it‚Äôs ADHD anyway? Or should I just focus on finding ways to support myself without a formal diagnosis and muddle through?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1758yl3/help_seeking_a_diagnosis_in_the_uk/,True,2023-10-11 08:18:34,False,7,False,False,1,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/1758yl3/help_seeking_a_diagnosis_in_the_uk/

I basically want something where I can set alarms all through the month at the start of the month (and obviously add whenever I need) to remind me to do certain things. So similar to calendar app, label certain alarms at certain times on certain days.

However - what I really need is it to give me an option to mark whether I‚Äôve done it or not. You know how the health app reminds you to take meds but you actually have to say if you‚Äôve done it or not? This works great for me because when I set alarms for myself I‚Äôm often not in a position to do the thing; I‚Äôll ignore and think that I‚Äôll do it later but then I‚Ä¶ just forget.

i am a senior in college right now, and i have been pulling myself through these past four years very, very roughly. i was on academic probation, and now after meeting with an advisor, i am unsure if i will be able to graduate on time (and lose my financial aid) because i am behind on credits. when i bring this up to my mom, about how i struggle with school and all my other issues, she says she thinks i have adhd because of the tiktoks she watches. it infuriates me. i lost that opportunity to get tested and diagnosed for free because she refused to accept it when i was younger. now it is my responsibility to figure out what my insurance *might* cover, and i feel so defeated. she said she denied it when i was younger because she didn't want me to ""rely"" on medication or use a diagnosis as an ""excuse not to work harder than everyone else"". i was just a kid needing help. i still am. 

i just don't know how to feel about it anymore. the validating comments from her now about my issues is nice, but bittersweet just because of how hard i begged for her to listen to me when i was younger. i love my mom, but she really hurt me. she knows this too, as it's something i've explained to her, so i'm really just venting here. sorry if this is emotionally a lot, i just had a really overwhelming day after meeting with the advisor and everything has spiraled from there.

909,174zl37,t3_174zl37,WineKasra,Music on physical media really helps me with chores. (And other assorted strats),"Obviously everyone's different but here's something I've found. 

Every time I put on a cd or even better a record, I find it so easy to get stuck into the chores I've been putting off that day. Full disclosure I am medicated which also helps but it's not like that makes me want to do them any more lol 

I think it's a combination of things that make this an effective tool for me. 
Choosing and turning on the music is something I have to physically do rather then tapping play on Spotify. And with a turntable that doesn't have auto return I need to go stop the music too every ~20mins. Great for forcing me off the couch and breaking up my routine of doing nothing all day.

The other two smaller benefits are that music playing means I can't start tiktok scrolling or getting lost in a 6 hour YouTube video about why Final Fantasy 3 is actually the most important RPG in history or something. As well as that, when I'm already up to do the music I might as well pick up a few clothes, turn on the laundry, load the dishwasher etc. 

Yes this is all helped by a lot of other smaller compensatory strategies. Like I've trained myself to accept that completing the first 20% of a job and stopping is better than not doing it at all, so start and see how much you can do (very helpful for surface cleaning. Cleaning one or two sections of a kitchen is still a big boost to your mood even if you still have a dirty stovetop). I've streamlined a lot of my chores like having a wand vacuum in the lounge instead of a big plug in vac in a hall cupboard, storing clothes hangers next to where you dry them and hanging them instantly rather than having a big pile of clean dry clothes you have to sort and fold/hang etc. And most importantly accepting that ""finding a home"" for clutter was my biggest problem, so having little containers everywhere to store sorted clutter rather than having it spread out (meds container here, keys/watch/loose change container there, random cords there, game controllers there etc.).

Anyway yeah. Make actively consuming music a part of your routine rather than being frustrated that passively playing your daily mix on Spotify doesn't make you want to spring clean like everyone on Instagram says it will. 

... P.S. pls don't go out and spend a grand on vinyl records convinced you're about change your life and start a cool new hobby that you're totally gonna stick to this time.

Or I tell myself I'm just gonna open Spotify to play some music and somehow end up on social media or in some Wikipedia rabbit hole. I'm medicated, but probably need my dose adjusted, and definitely need to work on my self-control... any tips or advice that helped you through college? 

Like I know of someone who would watch an episode of the show they're binging after completing an assignment, which might work for me if I had a hyperfixation show at the moment. 

Also worth noting that I'm going to community college, every professor organizes their content differently and this professor seems to be one where it's all over the place. Like the assignment is two clicks into the home page, but the reading material is 3 clicks on a different link and a login portal, they're hard to open at the same time, you need different reading materials for different assignments, etc. I'm also supposed to have a screen reader accomodation which i don't know how/where to install. Should I just make an appointment with the disability counselor or maybe ask the professor to help me after class?

Ticktack is an app that allows you to set reoccurring To-Do tasks on a completely customizable schedule. The app tracks these reoccurring tasks and creates your daily To Do list. 

Once you get your lists and chores scheduled, there is literally nothing else you have to do to remember what daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly household chores have to be done today.

I have a widget on my homescreen that shows me my household chores or appointments for the day. I can check them off from my phones homepage as I do them. I open my phone at least a thousand times a day so it is impossible to forget and not see my To Do list.

You can also invite your partners/roommate/kids to collaborate within the app and assign them tasks, or they can create their own reoccurring tasks with their own to do lists. Never hound your partner to do that thing you asked them to again. You can see when they check off their tasks in real time.

I feel so excited guys, I never have to remember on my own to change my sheets again   : D",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1751ohp/for_the_love_of_gawd_please_download_ticktack/,True,2023-10-11 01:11:13,False,7,False,False,9,0.91,/r/ADHD/comments/1751ohp/for_the_love_of_gawd_please_download_ticktack/

I have a class that I am *genuinely* interested in, but the professor has no late work policy meaning that you can turn things in whenever, she'll just grade them at the end of the semester. So no outside negative reinforcement, which is what I usually rely on to get things done. Promising myself treats doesn't work because I have no impulse control and I know I can just have the prize whenever I feel like it.

I feel like I have this huge weight on me at all times because I should be doing homework, but I simply *won't* do it, and I feel so bad about it I also won't do anything I enjoy.

&#x200B;

TLDR: 

I have struggled with with ADHD symptoms most of my life, I've listed a couple out here, but i could spend an entire thread listing what I've struggled with. I've been on antidepressants for 3-4 years with no help, and worsening symptoms. I see a psychotherapist who has brushed off ADHD many times. I was finally diagnosed a week and a half ago with ADHD-type C, but my psychotherapist doesn't think its correct and wants to put me on SSRIs again. 

&#x200B;

I 25f have felt like I have struggled with low moods, and motivation issues my whole life. Ever since I was a little girl, I always felt like I couldn't measure up to the others in my classes, I was told I always overreacted to every small thing, and I did struggle a lot in school. Due to my parents believing that grades were everything, I had tutors to support me all throughout school. 

&#x200B;

And I mean, throughout all of my schooling years. My typical day looked like this from 2nd grade till i completed high school:  
Id go to school and stay back for the school support classes and finish by 4pm, come home and eat and a tutor would arrive home at 4:30 to 5:30pm. I had another tutor that I went to at 6pm, and came back home at 7pm. I also attended weekend tutoring sessions. This went on until I graduated high school in my home country. While i did end up having good grades, I've always felt like I've had to work harder than everyone else.

Only problem is I feel like the newer members of the team are being prepped for it and are seen as favourites since they get more involved in things, I also have proof that they have been given more access than me.I also feel because of my openess of adhd that my managers see me as a nuisance and I was honest with them when I felt like they were mistreating me which they agreed with but I feel like they prefer people who keep quiet. My job is ok now but I feel like I should be progressing. I feel like if I don't get it that it will break me as I hate feeling underestimated and stuck in a rut.

Why can't I just be content with not getting promotion and just stay in the current job considering I'm lucky enough to have a job where others don't :( does anyone have advice , I don't want to end up as my relative.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17fio5z/rsd_applying_for_promotion_how_to_stay_in_a_job/,True,2023-10-24 17:47:09,False,2,False,False,1,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/17fio5z/rsd_applying_for_promotion_how_to_stay_in_a_job/

965,17fh9wd,t3_17fh9wd,maryca666,Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome?,"So I think I have Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome. I have ADHD and autism, I'm on Vyvanse and Sertraline.

Since I was a baby, I've been a terrible sleeper. When other babies slept two hours, I slept one. When I got older, around 5-10, I would get out of bed a million times to tell my parents I couldn't sleep. From the age of 11-23, I couldn't sleep before midnight. I would try all the sleep CD's, no screens, meditations, but it usually would take me 2-3 hours to sleep.

On top of that, since I was a child, I would be tired all day, and then at 9pm (sharp, daily) I would get a boost of energy and motivation, but then I'd have to sleep, so I'd lie in bed, my legs shaking because my brain was finally ready to do stuff I haven't been able to do all day.

Now I'm in uni, I have to get up at 6am, so to be able to have energy I need 8 hours (I never get 8 hours, unless it's the weekend, so I'm always tired), which means I have to be asleep at like 9-9:30pm, which is impossible. I have NEVER been able to sleep at 9. I have once or twice been able to sleep at 10pm, but that's a rarity.

I'm so tired. I have basically not slept good for two months now, which makes me too tired to cook or eat or drink water, which makes me more tired.

I'm a full-time college student, and I was recently diagnosed with ADHD about two months ago to help adjust to a new school environment. My starting dose at the beginning of my prescription was 1 5mg Adderall IR in the morning; I had a follow-up appointment with my doctor two weeks later to report any feedback and how the meds were working. I told him they were working, but I often would have on-and-off days where the meds felt like they didn't 'kick in,' often leading to wasted hours when studying. After the follow-up appointment, he suggested that I switch to 10mg Adderall twice daily to see if it would help with studying hours and lectures.  
A few weeks have passed, and at the beginning of the new prescription, things were great in terms of productivity; I was getting everything done along with eating well and a great sleep schedule. I think the ""honeymoon"" phase is starting to wear off, and I notice myself spacing out much more than I was in the weeks prior (it's starting to feel like the 5mg prescription at the beginning).  
I usually take the meds in 5-hour intervals (one at 8 am and another at 1), but recently I've tried taking them in the 3-4 hour range for a couple of days. I feel like shortening the time in between has helped me stay on one task until completion.  
After my recent visit with the doctor, i told him the same description of what I was feeling and he suggested I should stay on the 10mg for another two months and then report back. My question is, should I schedule another appointment earlier to ask for a dosage increase?

983,17fe8ll,t3_17fe8ll,Repulsive_Ad_111,Improvement of Speech,"I used to struggle with articulation, mumbling, speaking too quickly and quietly, even merging words together because my thoughts raced ahead of my speech. However, after watching Elon Musk's appearance on Joe Rogan's Podcast (#1169), I made an interesting observation. Elon, who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, didn't always respond rapidly to questions. Instead, he took a moment to process the question, thought about it, and then delivered his response deliberately, sometimes with breaks. Surprisingly, he remained engaging, and it didn't seem awkward at all. Inspired by this, I tried the same approach.

Slowing down my speech has significantly improved the alignment between my thoughts and words. While occasional mental blocks occur, the slower pace allows me to find simpler ways to express myself when I can't immediately find the right words.

I genuinely love learning, and my major, and have big plans for what I plan to do with this before anyone comments that uni might not be for me. I love labs, and getting actual hands-on work solving equations on my own, figuring things out, piecing things together in the lab. What I absolutely cannot deal with are the lectures and I feel like there's nothing I can do in this struggle except for continue being miserable.

I find that I cannot learn on someone ELSE's pace. I've had this issue way before I was even in high school when I would learn and pick things up quicker than other kids. I can't stand it when professors try to walk the class through a problem. Whenever it's put onto the board, I have an inclination to naturally want to try and work through it myself, get at least a little bit of time before going over the steps. No, they'll write it down then continue droning on about step one when I'm nearly halfway done. I develop physical symptoms from it and start twitching, shaking, I feel the mental pain of sitting still in my chest to the point where it is unbearable, uncomfortable, and to the point of developing physical anxiety symptoms.

I just cannot effectively learn or be comfortable sitting completely still for an hour.

I have been diagnosed with ADHD a year ago. My mom considered diagnosing me when I was a kid, but didn't bother because she didn't want to put me on meds as a kid anyway. In university, I've been struggling to study, so I have finally gotten the diagnosis and been seeing a psychiatrist to try out meds.

I am currently on methylphenidate 60 mgs after being on 40 mgs and 20 to start with. There isn't much of a difference in impulsivity and focus like what I've heard from others. My brain isn't *quiet*, like some people describe. The main difference is in motivation. The meds feel like the first time I tried coffee, where I got very motivated and driven to get stuff done, which is great because I am generally very unhappy with how passive I am in life.

However, this motivation is not specifically directed toward the ""right"" things, which I suppose I can't expect, but the problem is that it motivates me to do the wrong things. As I understand it, my energy and motivation is *generally* heightened, which leads to things I was already motivated to do being incredibly interesting. Things that are harder to do are easier to do too, but they don't stand a chance against the pull of my natural interests.

I'm starting to worry that I'll never be able to do the things that I don't want to do, because I can't realistically live a life where everything is interesting to me, all the time. I have tried imposing rules and restrictions on myself, but my willpower is used up on internal friction and I end up burned out by the bare minimum.

Would appreciate some advice, whether you think I'm on the wrong medication, too low a dosage or making things difficult for myself in some other way.

I‚Äôm 22, adhd anxiety etc etc. I always had a good circle of friends growing up and while in school but now I live in a different country (have for the last 6 years) and I‚Äôm mostly friendless. I met people here, and one I still talk to very occasionally online because she doesn‚Äôt live local anymore. 

But my problem is maintaining and making friends. This has come about because a friend of a friend/acquaintance messaged me to say it was nice meeting me and we should grab a coffee if I was down because  she thinks we have a lot in common. 

It‚Äôs a good thing, I know that subjectively. Bt I just can‚Äôt shake the anxiety of the thought of meeting up with someone new and talking (even though I‚Äôd probably enjoy myself once there). It‚Äôs the anxiety, and the anxiety of knowing that in 6 years I‚Äôve had about 8 friends that I used to see/talk to regularly but within the last 4 I have let them all go slowly over time through not speaking/ going out. 

My adhd makes it hard to manage my day to day already, that‚Äôs just personal life and focusing on trying to make a career for myself. And I just have this nagging voice in my head asking ‚Äúwhy go through all the effort making a friend, that you know you‚Äôll eventually let down?‚Äù

It sucks. I know this would be good for me, to make friends with these girls and have a more normal existence that isn‚Äôt spend only around family, myself and my bf. It just feels like I don‚Äôt have the time already and that gives me even MORE anxiety. 

So I turn this question to you guys. What do your friendships look like? How do you maintain them?

However, I often find it somewhat impossible to find my personal style as my personality seems to be constantly changing, and more annoyingly, whenever I have a hyper fixation on something I end up changing all of my personal tastes to try to reflect said thing. it probably seems a bit weird, but I get this thing where instead of wanting to buy T-shirts or weird little figurines I try to incorporate aspects of said thing into my personal style. for instance, a couple of years ago I was really into this one 80s movie and tried to dress very 80s despite how I don't actually care that much about the era. This wouldn't be a problem if it was just a couple items in my closet but at this point most of my nice clothing is stuff I cant actually wear cause its too hyper specific for ever wearing outside.

I would probably be using them in class so I would need a pair that blocks out talking as much as possible. I've used loop earplugs before which have really helped, but I keep losing them, plus I need some more headphones anyway. Does anyone have any recommendations for headphones with good noise cancellation? Comfort is VERY important to me, since my cheap headphones at the moment, and ones I've used in the past, get uncomfortable quite quickly and squish my ears. Ideally I'd prefer an ear cup that's on the larger size. I've worn my friend's soundcore 30s before and I found them to be the kind of comfort level that I'm looking for.

I've been mainly looking at the Bose NC700, or the Bose QC45 but I'm not sure if there are better options. I've also considered the Sony xm4s but I've read that they have a slight hiss when on full noise cancelling mode, which has put me off a bit. I'm planning to buy second hand (probably on ebay). I'm also a bass player so I would quite like headphones with a strong bass/ kick drum, but I'm not an audiophile so small sound differences between models probably won't impact me too much. I do also like the idea of headphones which have an app to adjust the settings (which I'm pretty sure Sony and Bose have for some of their models).

Only failing college time and time again compares in terms of stress levels, and I am 37yo so that is a flashback I didn't anticipate to re-live. Here is the situation.

Pro's:

\- The new job pays better, has a better ""status"" and better future career dev. opportunities

\- In theory it should suit my brain as it has to do a lot with data analytics, process optimisation, system fixes etc. All of the things I have shown to be good at before, hence they gave me the promotion.

\- I went for the promotion because after 2 years I was already severely bored with the previous role.

Con's:

\- I make up my own road map, need to run long term projects and squeeze in a lot of different focus work into every day - in practice I am in total paralysis and miserable 70% of the time

\-  I am back to trying to compensate on the weekends. I fail to do so every time, but I still have the anxiety around wanting to try to work on a Saturday and Sunday, which leaves me with no relief from the stress.

\- I hate the team. They are territorial, praise every single bs thing they do, and I cannot help to feel deep resentment for them.

im also currently waiting for my appointment with a neurologist to get diagnosed, which is what im waiting for and its a super long process especially with my health insurance, and i would have to pretty much call every week for an earlier spot for an appointment, so i want to be able to maintain productivity while im waiting. its been a rough couple weeks for me so yeah, if you guys have any advice to see a psychiatrist or neurologist earlier under medi-cal, lmk!

Step 1. 
You're gonna need two columns.

Your left column is gonna be all the major To Dos that you can think of off the top of your head. Like making an appointment, cleaning the kitchen etcetc. This can be for the day, the week, whatever.

Your right column will be your Side Quests (or whatever you like to call it).
This will be where you keep a running list of chores/tasks that you fill out as you go. 

I noticed myself getting so depleted and disappointed in myself whenever I only could check one thing or sometimes nothing off my main To Do-list. But I had in fact been doing A BUNCH of other Side Quests, often due to getting distracted while trying to finish something on my main list, that had also really been needing to be done but hadn't felt ""urgent"" or important enough to write down. So, after the fact, filling in all my completed Side Quests and checking them off made me feel so much better and validated for the effort I actually had put in during the day.

I have this annoying tendancy to not get things done that I really wish to do:read books, write stories for dnd (and other systems), make things ect.

At this moment in time im working my way through darksouls in order to get better with failing at things.

Question context: games are my main source of calm and make me feel happy (I am aware that that is a statement). This maybe because it makes me feel like I am good at something, and all of the visual, audio and physical inputs i get from them. It is also my main interaction with my dad

Questions: should I stop playing games for a time so that i can try and start introducing other things for me to do? Would playing only when my dad is on be better?

&#x200B;

to give an example, in class during lectures i usually doodle in class and listen to music at a low volume with one airpod only all while taking notes (when i don't take notes, i go back to doodling) i am doing four things at once which is kind of crazy haha (listening to the lecture, having low volume music, doodling, taking notes) but i swear it works for me.

&#x200B;

while i believe that most people just look at the professor while they give their lecture and take notes occasionally (in this class we are not constantly writing notes). i have always done this sort of thing when it comes to paying attention to something else. 

&#x200B;

another example is that when i watch a youtube video or a tv show, i am always doing something else no matter what. i still have my full attention on the main thing though. usually what i do is draw or play games with the tv/screen in front of me.

&#x200B;

one more example, is when i practice guitar, i have a youtube video or tv show in the background as i practice. i really need that external stimulus as i play. i need some form of background talking the entire time, not super loud of course, otherwise i just can't focus. i have to be focusing on two things at once at any capacity otherwise i just can't do it. whenever i do anything, other than writing/typing for the most part, i would say that i require something in the background or something else to do in order to do the actual task. if i do not have any other alternative small activity or external noise, it is really hard for me to cope.

I suffer from a lot of impulsivity issues, (shopping, hair changes, etc.), inability to relax, unable to remember conversations and priorities with my husband, etc., and it‚Äôs putting a lot of stress in my life. 

I have only JUST recently (in the last month) realized it was because of my ADHD and my dr confirmed it. 

I had an appointment with my new med-mgmt dr a little over a week ago and he basically put the ball in my court as to what I wanted to try. I told him what issues I was having (see above) So far I have tried Vyvanse (generic-10mg) and I both love and hate it. It gives me a ton of energy and motivation, but I have no control over what direction the ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù takes me.  Example: yesterday, I wanted to clean my kitchen, plus a few other small things. Instead I hyper-focused on one thing for a couple hours and had to scramble to get what needed to be done. This is just one example. This happens daily/every day I take this. 

I need something that will help with my impulsive nature and inability to relax. I keep trying to research NON-stimulant medications bc that is what I would prefer, but I‚Äôm not having much luck.

I do love my phone and the instant stimulation I get from this little machine ‚Äî but I hate it at the same time. On some days I waste hours and hours, and it makes me kind of sad.

I‚Äôve experimented with different ways to lower my screen time. I tried apps, and yes, some of them definitely had a positive impact. But it's pretty easy to just bypass them. I also got myself a dumb phone and never used it because it suddenly seemed too radical to me (of course, after I bought it). After all, I do like having a smartphone.

What I found works pretty well for me is to create *a dedicated place* at home for my phone. So creating a physical distance to it ‚Äì rather than having it with me *all the time*, like it is a part of my body.

I‚Äôm a designer who has a lot of ideas, and I recently came up with a concept that I believe would be pretty ADHD-friendly: A device that helps us spend less time on the phone. It's a little house (literally) where you put your phone in.

It would be connected to the internet (I know, the irony) but for a good reason: It would record your downtime and make it accessible in a companion app. So instead of *avoiding screen time* you would be *accumulating downtime*, which I believe is much more rewarding! The app would have friendly gamification (think of Duolingo's streak). You would set a daily or weekly downtime goal, which would be completely up to you. Every minute of downtime would be acknowledged, encouraging users to make small steps.

I looked through everything and there are *volumes upon volumes* of files for my brothers. School records, handwritten notes/cards, etc. For me? Nothing. Not a single solitary file. 

My parents don't believe I have ADHD because I, ""did well in school"" and was ""well behaved"" and now I feel like they've erased my entire history too.

But when I bring up mental health? Suddenly I was the perfect child. 

I've been with my partner for 3 years but we've known each other for close to 14, could I involve him? Can I get a complete screening without input from my parents? In the US, do I really need input from someone who knew me pre-12 y/o?

I've heard some suspicions of other mental conditions being ""more in touch"" with the esoteric side of things. What do you think about ADHD and the metaphysical?

Personally I have no idea if ADHD has any influence, but I do believe in spirits and a spiritual realm to a degree. I'd put myself as a 7 on the woo-a-meter. The metaphysical, paranormal, and high strangeness is one of my hyper fixations so there's that.. That being said I am very cautious in assigning anything a paranormal origin.

When I'm reading, I feel the urge/impulse to finish the text quickly; otherwise, I would feel like I'm spending too much time on them or wasting time reading ""unwanted"" parts. But this leads to poor comprehension, and I would have to re-read them anyway (spending more time trying to comprehend the text that I would have avoided if I had just patiently read the text without rushing through in the first place).

When I'm reading, it feels as if my eyes are ""switching between"" words randomly (like I'd read one word in the first sentence, skip the rest, two words in the next sentence, skip the rest, and so on). When I see a text material, my eyes will capture the ""whole"" text (not just the line I'm currently trying to read), leading to jumping around the text.

I tried using bionic reading extension on my browser. Although I found it useful, it doesn't work properly on web pages with non-compatible fonts (most of them) and doesn't work with PDF files.

I'm trying to be mindful while reading, such as focusing on my breath while reading or monitoring the seconds I'm spending reading a text (to convince myself that I'm not spending ""too much time"" or wasting time by reading it slowly). But it's not always effective.

I would appreciate it if you could give me some guidance, reading techniques, or tips. Thank you in advance.

I've heard that using a planner can be a game-changer, especially for individuals with ADHD, helping with organization, focus, and time management.

I'm particularly interested in learning about specific features that have proven helpful. Is there a particular layout, design, or format that you find effective? Are there planners with built-in strategies for managing ADHD symptoms? Any input on how to customize planners to better suit the needs of ADHD individuals would be greatly appreciated.

The problem I‚Äôm having is that I forget a lot of what people tell me and that causes issues in my relationships.

And I won‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôm doing it and I feel terrible about it. 

My mind has a lot of chatter and I have trouble holding what other people give me because of that. I‚Äôll forget things that have happened to them, but It will come back to me it if it gets brought up again. So it‚Äôs really challenging. I don‚Äôt want the people around me to feel that I don‚Äôt care about them, because I really do care for them.

I tend to forget things about myself too. Like what I ate for dinner this past week, what my favorite song is, or what are things I like doing in my free time etc. sometimes my mind just goes blank.

I‚Äôm curious to see if anyone has similar struggles and what they‚Äôre experiences with it are like. What tools or tips may help with this. If medicine helped with this.

He‚Äôs also GT and does generally well in school, so far, he‚Äôs a freshman this year. I am also a teacher and he is in my science class this year (Bio Honors.) I finally see what his teachers have been experiencing and saying for years. 

He does all his work at the *speed of light*. Like, I was usually the first one done when I was a student, but this is an entirely new level. He completes things that takes other students, including honors kids, 3-4x as long. 

Because he‚Äôs so fast, he often doesn‚Äôt think through things as well as he should and gives answers, that while superficially correct, don‚Äôt often get the real point or the deeper meaning. He‚Äôs just not anywhere approaching thorough. 

He‚Äôs also not great at working in groups because he‚Äôs instantly so far ahead of everyone else and if he slows down for them, they ‚Äúgo too slow‚Äù and he‚Äôs gets restless and disruptive. His group members are more thorough and he could benefit from paying attention to their thinking process. 

All my best efforts to get him to *slow down* even a little to think through things and think more deeply have failed. 

I‚Äôm struggling to decide if this is something I really need to crack down on and train him (it will be a battle and struggle) to slow down. Or do I just accept it and count on him slowing down when it really matters at some point n the future? For example, he‚Äôs more thorough and detail oriented in high interest things like his Digital Game Development class, which is what he wants to pursue as a career. 

Do you wish someone would have slowed you down and made you learn more ‚Äúthorough thinking‚Äù skills? Or did you figure it out when it mattered?

When I decide to learn at least one specific song, then at some point I still give up halfway through. But when I'm drawing, playing a video game, or lifting weights, I'd rather die than give up before I reach the goal I've set in my head. 

I like the way my guitar looks, I'd like to take it apart, paint it, improve it. But I don't like playing it, I don't like learning songs. I don't see the point, I can just turn up a song on YT and listen to it. Why would I spend so much time learning how to play just a parody of the original song (without vocals, drums and with no bass)? Sounds like a waste of time without benefits. And I don't like the noise it makes on overdrive when I'm not touching strings.

I have refused to take it due to me being very stubborn and as well as side effects and dependency concerns. I also have not had the best experience with psychiatry and medications. I took plethora of medications and cocktails. Only one of them benefited me while the others numbed me, made me a zombie, or had other significant unpleasant side effects. I didn‚Äôt like the constant push to take more medications, increase each dosage. It wasn‚Äôt doing anything. I stopped all medications after I started working out and started doing MMA.  I have known I have ADHD for 3 years now but when I analyze my behaviors I realized that I probably have had it since I was 14-15.

I felt very uncomfortable with how it felt like a ‚Äúsingle line‚Äù thinking. I‚Äôm usually bad with carrying conversations because it‚Äôs just so much stuff in my head.

(Does/did anyone else get tongue tied often before taking their medication? Just Curious) 

I'll admit I haven't rode my bike since I've been diagnosed because I've been focusing on strength training. I don't always take my medication on the weekend (per docs request) and yesterday I didn't.  Any who, I always noticed I zoned out during rides, but this was different. I noticed the bike ride felt nearly the same as my medication, and it was wild.  I never realized how riding my bike helped me so significantly before, but I finally was able to compare. While my friends were chatting on the ride I was just gettin it. I was hyper focused, but in a good way. If that makes since.

I was diagnosed adhd when my kid was around 8months old. Medicated since 14months old (after I‚Äôd stopped breast feeding).

Since medication, this is the most helpful thing for mornings. Now I take my meds 10 mins before I need to wake and I‚Äôm a proper functioning adult. It‚Äôs been incredible and life for me & my husband is so much easier.

Kid is now 3yrs old. Kid in a bad sleep phase at the moment and going to bed so so late. Wakes up at the same time. Often before me. Kid wakes me up most mornings, I.e. before I‚Äôve had a chance to take meds. 

It‚Äôs now becoming a bit of a routine that kid is awake for half an hour to an hour before me. Which is obviously unacceptable.

Finished my [B.Sc](https://B.Sc) a year ago, worked for a year at a job without really developing any particular skills relevant to the field. Moved back to my parents house recently, since staying where I worked meant having no close friends nearby or anyone I know, apart for my ex.  
My country is at war, people were brutally massacred and the Northern front (where I live) is about to erupt any day now.

To top that off - saw my ex with the guy I was told to not worry about, they're somewhere safe from the war. We stopped contacting each other a while ago, but the feelings of rejection and betrayal hit me just now. It's been a few days since but the feeling of dull pain in my chest won't really go away.

Everything is just too much... you'd think the imminent danger of losing my home and maybe my life would override everything else but it's all just piling up into one big heap of stress, shame, inferiority, anger and fear. My head feels like its being squeezed with a thousand rubber-bands, and my motivation to do pretty much anything is non-existent.  
I'm going to therapy but its only been a few meetings and it's pretty expensive, I don't think I can afford to keep going.  
Feels as if I'm terrified by the sight of me wasting away and my only reaction to it is freezing in place.

I was diagnosed with ADHD (ADD) when I was around 5

For many years now ive been fighting with my medication, most trials would end up me having anxiety

(like when have too much caffeine in your)

Finally two years ago I thought I'd struck gold with Adderall however It took me a while to piece it together,  Adderall would do the opposite of most meds and make me super fucking tired.

In my recent exam in software engineering for example I had gone completely blank and forgot how to do code.

So..

Just now I've switched back to the one that started it all, Rubfin and it's giving me anxiety once again...

I'm at the point of breaking down

I either have to be super tired or super anxious

I can do code and engineering I know I can but not with eithier of these..

1221,17e8gaf,t3_17e8gaf,Tinacrowell82,"Help!!!! Forced to change drs, new one will not prescribe my ADHD meds previously prescribed, never abused.","Please, no judgement. Saw a psychiatrist for years who prescribed me Vyvanse. Lost my insurance and couldn't afford it. Ended up switching to a PCP who wrote my other couple of medications with no issues. I never requested Vyvanse due to cost. Still no insurance. PCP moved without any prior notice to me. 

Figured I needed to get back to a psychiatrist and try alternatives. She was the first Dr I could get into see before running out of my Lexapro. My now untreated ADHD has gotten so bad it's affecting my entire life, especially my job. 

While taking Vyvanse as prescribed, never abused, I always got my job done easily and could help others as well. I need a stimulate (again, not a drug abuser, although I don't judge anyone) that will help with mood boost and energy. It's the only way I feel ""normal"". I've tried the non stimulate ones with no results. 

Willing to try anything to help. It's making my depression worse bc I constantly worry about messing up. 

On a budget so I'd like to be able to find one to two things to help. Sites and name brands would really help me. I've done so many searches for weeks and can't decide what to get. Can't afford to keep trying things that do not work at all.

I just switched to Concerta from Adderall XR after a short hiatus. I'm not seeking advice about the differences between these two. However, upon arriving at my hospital pharmacy, they told me that they could only offer me the brand name version this month due to the stimulant shortage. Thus, I had to pay 6x the normal cost of generics to get my medications despite a generic existing (methylphenidate) without any warning. I was told this would be hit-or-miss every month, so I have no way of knowing if I'm paying the generic or brand name price until I arrive to pickup.

I understand I am preaching to the choir about this, but I am pissed. This is not economically feasible for me to maybe pay brand name prices every month, and I really benefit from stimulant medication. I'm not sure what to do. 

Has anyone been through this before and found a way to cut medication costs? Would switching to a new pharmacy make a difference? (My current pharmacy does not accept GoodRx btw)

I really, really hope this stimulant shortage ends soon, as this is impeding many people including myself from being able to afford care.

I'm a 26-year-old male taking 70mg of Vyvanse, and I'm dealing with some annoying side effects. As the medication wears off, I experience an intense buzzing and tingling sensation in my legs and feet, almost like an electric current running from my back to my limbs. I've also noticed facial tingling around my eyebrows.

Since starting Vyvanse, I've also been plagued by severe neck and back pain, accompanied by intermittent limb stiffness and discomfort. I constantly clench my jaw and muscles and have severe muscle tension, seems never-ending.

Furthermore, my heart rate is fluctuating dramatically. When I'm lying down, it can range from 85-90 beats per minute, but while walking or sitting at my computer, it can shoot up to 115-150. I've also been struggling with shallow breathing and occasionally even forgetting to breathe properly. On top of that, I experience unexpected bursts of adrenaline or anxiety... 

I have been to two cardiologist and had 2 holter monitors, I had a back, neck and brain MRI, blood tests and all came back completely normal and my doctor is not worried and just tells me not to worry.

I lead a fairly sedentary lifestyle, spending about 10 hours a day in front of a computer working If anyone out there can relate to these symptoms or offer insights on how to cope with these side effects, I'd greatly appreciate your input.

I would love to hear success stories of those of you who felt so swamped, and are doing much better now. Was it medication? Therapy? Combination? I've been feeling quite hopeless lately, and I would like to believe my life has more to it than these struggles.

A bit of background: I'm 23, and over the years I've been diagnosed with multiple mental health issues. ADHD is a recent diagnosis, within the past 2 years. I was on anti-depressants as a child and they just seemed to make things worse. Now as an adult I realize this was probably due to undiagnosed ADHD. I was on Adderall for a long time, but recently I've started to have intense body aches and I am unable to continue taking it on it's own. I've begun to accept that ADHD is not my only ""issue"", and that I probably need a combination of medications to manage my depression and anxiety as well as my ruminations.

I want to become a better person, for myself and for the people I care about. My anxiety, depression, and ADHD symptoms make it very difficult for me. I want to develop close intimate friendships, live a more organized life, and be able to do things I think I would enjoy if I weren't so bogged down by these intense fears I have about most situations.

Her classes are absolutely ridiculous, teaching grown ups with careers that they should Journal, make SMART goals, and use the Pomodoro method. She's incredibly demeaning and rude, and the weirdest part is that she claims she also has ADHD. 

These classes have been all I can think about recently, it's honestly enraging that someone with a doctorate of psychology, who is apparently ADHD, has no understanding of what ADHD actually is. She's literally just telling us to ""be better"" and ""teaching"" the most basic organizational skills with no thought as to how those would work for someone who is ADHD.

1285,17dtrq3,t3_17dtrq3,behnamxx,Cure of ADHD : Notes App,"Hi i'm 29 years old .

5 months ago i was diagnosed with adhd and started getting medication


always in my life i struggled with adhd symptoms especially in the areas of goal oriented and executive functions .


before even formally being diagnosed i wondered if there is a way to relieve symptoms of the disorder by creating an attention provoking tool , something simple and accessible like the notes app on the phone , and creating enough notes to cover different areas that the person performs poorly .


I worked on the idea for months and tried to improve it continuously . The solution works best for me and maybe not be the best answer for someone else but i think at least the structure would be inspiring .


I maintain 3 different notes in my notes app named FACTS , GOALS and TASKS . I regularly check them , read the contents and if required , modify or rearrange the contents .


The FACTS note consists of simple phrases that reading them regularly would instigate desired changes in beliefs .


At any moment i search for my most problematic performance , think about their roots and try to find the best possible solution , then create a simple phrase out of it and add it to the note .


The second note is GOALS . First i defined my major and general objectives that i want to achieve in the long term , namely fitness , healthcare , career , relationship and so on (it's personal) then i write the first steps towards each of them specifically and concisely .


trying to keep the list as short , brief and grouped as possible so i can get the whole map of my tasks in a couple of seconds . When each task is over , remove it and add the next steps unveiled .


The last note is TASKS . That is basically the current moment worktable of mind . The list consists of choosen tasks from previous note for this very day .


some tasks by nature recur everyday like wakeup routine or exercise so they remain on the list , some are like milestones you should reach everyday like reading 20 pages of a book , some are one-time tasks and will be removed whenever completed .


It's important to limit the tasks to a small number so as to not to overflow the limited capacity of an adhd mind .


I appreciate any suggestions to my three note system for overcoming executive and cognitive disfunction as i yet still trying to improve it especially third note .


I shared this method because these simple notes have reliefed me from years of severe depressive nihilistic , zero productivity life and made me a hopeful , somewhat productive man .

1316,17d7dq9,t3_17d7dq9,Healthy-Brother9186,"I know I am hard to love, will someone ever love me as I am?","Hello,

I just got out of a 4 years relationship. We moved in together and it became apparent I was hiding my adhd flaws. I was medicated and it was great but then I ran out and couldn‚Äôt find a family doctor, the walk in clinic would give me my medication without paperwork, and my old college still hasn‚Äôt released d my health records after weeks of asking and calling. 

It was hard to adjust to sharing a space with someone else. Forgetting to do things like brush my teeth, leaving dishes sometimes,  or staying on top of tasks, my ex said it felt like I was a child and that reminding me to to things was exhausting. So I started to change. I started going to therapy, making lists, setting reminders, setting daily cleaning schedules, setting a weekly cleaning date, getting into routines, starting to go through all the random piles and shit I had. But it still was never enough for them. If I was doing one thing, they had to remind me to do something else. 

I feel like they were never willing to see the growth. I feel unlovable and that no one will ever love me or accept me as I am medicated or unmedicated. And it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt do anything. I have two jobs, I work hard, I‚Äôm working on being good with my money, I help out, I cook, I clean, I run errands. Some stuff like my short term memory and emotional regulation is hard to control. I think they saw what I was like every day and got sick of it. Doesn‚Äôt help they belittled me every day. But are there people out there that will love me even with my flaws? It‚Äôs hard to imagine when my ex pressured me to be perfect all the time.

I feel like with my ADHD, I am incapable of being loved as I am. It feels like I will always be too much even with the steps I have taken to become better. They always used to tell me I was childish, that I had issues, and that it was hard to be around me at times. I truly believe I‚Äôm love and accepting people as they are and working through things together. And I never once pointed out their flaws. But they didn‚Äôt see it that way. I feel wholeheartedly that I am not worthy of love and that there will always be something I do that pushes people away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17d7dq9/i_know_i_am_hard_to_love_will_someone_ever_love/,True,2023-10-21 17:12:18,2023-10-21 17:19:48,8,False,False,3,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/17d7dq9/i_know_i_am_hard_to_love_will_someone_ever_love/

It's the usual, I can't focus on the task and I keep falling behind, I can't focus on my studies and I find it hard to even start on my assignments.

I don't know why but no matter how much I try, and I really did, I can't force myself to start, and when I did I can barely continue. 

My biggest problem is how I feel nothing about my overwhelming workload.

I don't feel fear or anxious when I don't do things, and when I do, it never last long, that lack of emotion makes it even harder for me to care and start doing things.

I know how this is gonna end for me if I don't pass it on time or do it at all, but it just feels inconsequential for me no matter how hard I convinced myself.

When I tried to convince myself to do it, I just ended up cleaning the house and tidying my desk but no work.

My biggest issue is reading, I really need to read this thing to write something about it but I can't force myself.

It's easy I know that, it's super easy, I already have guide question I just need to answer, I have tabs open that are relevant to the question, it's really easy, but I can't do it.

My brain keep blocking everything and I feel like giving up right now, I know I'm not gonna finish this, I don't even know how to feel knowing I didn't even get to begin doing it, it's so important but I can't do it.

1319,17djxfh,t3_17djxfh,tghjfhy,Do any of you as Adults related to ODD symptoms (oppositional defiance disorder)?,"My husband is an 8th grade teacher in a district that is very on top of it for assisting students with various issues that need more support, so he understands and see a lot of kids with all kinds of things. When it comes to the ODD kids, he said they remind him of me and how I act (not in a bad way).

 Though it can only be diagnosed in childhood, I was looking through the symptoms and learning more about it from psychologists online, and I can totally attest it fits me very well. From my understanding, it's that you have a cognitive error essneitally where you think people are having a great injustice upon you even though it's rather innocuous perhaps, your response is logical in your mindset but not in reality. Grearly paraphrasing of course. It also could explain my frequent issues with every workplace, some of my martial issues, incessant arguments online (don't look my my most recent reddit comments lol), and my sometimes overwhelming vengefulness that I think is kinda ugly. I'm not at all diagnosing myself though, just relate to it, and knowing it could just be a specific cognitive problem gives me some relief it's not me just being a bad and angry person.

There seems to be a question if it exists in adults or not. I'll let the professionals figure that out. I did however hear that there's a good overlap with ADHD and ODD, someone said that adhd people often have sub clinical ODD.

Looking back it explains much of my childhood behavior. If I had a more mental health focused environment I probably would have been diagnosed with ODD (and ADHD, took well into grad school for that one) as a child. I'm like 97% sure of that.

Just during the day I got stuck for 4 Hours not knowing if I should do A or B eventually deciding B because I still have time to do A but forgot about C D E And F. I just can't anymore...
I just hate myself. Not even my body or something I just hate myself. I have literally nothing, And I mean ABSOLUTELY nothing nice to say about myself. I don't think I ever agreed with a single compliment I ever recieved... I only ever agreed with the insults. I completely gave up on trying to explain anything to my family... They are too old fashioned to even try and understand my struggles... Yes they have struggles too but that doesn't give them right to insult and belittle me for my own struggles... I know that... But at the end of the day I mostly agree with the insults...
To top my cruel joke of a life off I can barely read anymore... Its like how I react to perfume or hyperfocusing too long. I get really sick. Once I even threw up.
I'm just a failure. A shattered mind. A walking glass sculpture that was shattered years ago but Is ONLY keeping itself together using comfort items...

1338,17dfidn,t3_17dfidn,Otherwise-Ad5053,I'm finally convinced that I have ADHD! Please tell me meds will help with the debilitating symptoms! (Details inside),"Over the years my mental health got worse and worse, and ended up crippling fear and anxiety for all the fuck ups and got put on anti depressants.

The meds helped a bit, but generally have struggled immensely to fix my life too the point that family had to step in and help because it just became too much!!

There worst are:
- obsessive worrying
- vivid images of worst outcomes making working on certain things full of crippling fear
- struggle doing admin and chores, despite repeatedly telling myself to do it
- working months without getting paid due to anxiety in filing in timesheets, for unjustified fears like not getting paid for sending them late
- avoidance of stressful things
- struggle to sit and stay focus when absolutely necessary
- obsessing about out of scope work that isn't directly related to what I'm meant to do
- failing to notify holidays causing me to work two months straight, only taking days off sick due to burn out

Upsides have been:
- occasionally create highly valued pieces of work when I get obsessed on something
- high creativity and problem solving that sometimes can exceed that of my colleagues
- very chatty and engaging, and generally colleagues found me very likeable (which helped not get fired a couple of times when I messed up)

I'm going through a weird stage of my life where people are helping fix my life, but it's not enough and I need to put in more effort. While I also landed an amazing job full of potential, with little micromanagement and a lot of freedom. But I cannot mess this up!

1344,17deltn,t3_17deltn,blacksphinx_,Wanting to seek diagnosis but scared I don't have ADHD,"I have been experiencing ADHD like symptoms for as long as I can remember. It started to cause problems for me around third grade when school got into more ""real"" academics. Back then I remember struggling to complete homework, I could hold my attention in class. I was never excessively hyperactive just kinda fidgety.  
My third grade teacher even thought I had ADHD and tried to get me into extra help/ special needs program the school had however my father denied I had it. I remember when they told me about it my parents told me what they thought I had and explained to me briefly what that was and I thought they might have been right.  
My senior year in high school, I barely graduated and was working at an auto shop over the summer. After the summer was over I started going to community college part time while I was working. At work I would be forgetful rush hastily through tasks, overlook details etc.  Eventually my boss pulled me into his office one last time. I had left an oil drain plug loose after an oil change. He told me basically that I am too forgetful and that he can't have me working on customer cars for liability reasons. He was very kind about it and suggested I go see someone to figure out my shit.   
I tried to just focus on school after that but I couldn't When COVID hit and class was online I had to drop out. I got another auto job and still had the same difficulties so I quit before they realized and fired me.  
I want to get formally diagnosed as now I am pretty convinced that is ADHD but I am terrified that I don't actually have ADHD. I am reluctant to believe that I'm wrong because everyone I see who has ADHD or talks about it sounds like they are describing me to a T. I'm just so terrified they are going to tell me I'm fine.

I've been struggling with ADHD and depression my almost my whole life and only really in the past few years but no matter what I try I can't seem to be able to take control of my focus when I need to.   
Due to having ADHD and depression, things are very odd for me. My energy is tided to my mood which always feels down, which I can't concentrate on anything because my mood is so down and my mood is down because of my energy. I feel deflated all the time... I don't have any control over my mood and my mood I can control me.    


Depression and ADHD is a dick of a mix. When my depressive thoughts start bouncing around the old noggin and the negative thoughts start building... I challenge every crap thought until my Asshole Google (my name for depressive adhd) starts search up more crap and the cycle continues until I get exhausted.   


I don't really know of a way to challenge this crap in a way thats will effectively keep that asshole google from booting up and berating me to unconsciousness.   


At the end of these moments, ""I always end up thinking I want out"" and that in itself is a good thing I think, but its also something that asshole google likes to use as another ""Way out"" if you catch my depressive drift.   


Enough of my rambling, but ultimately as you can see, I want out.... so I can maybe actaully start living my life instead of just surviving it. So, if any of you having some tips or tricks, directions to point, anything really that would be super helpful and appreciated.

Initially, the medication worked well, but recently its effectiveness has diminished.

Now, I often feel jittery, with my heart racing. Despite experimenting with dietary solutions, the results are inconsistent. For instance, sometimes taking the 40mg dose after a non-acidic breakfast works wonders, but other times it doesn't make a difference. I've also attempted mental conditioning, telling myself the medication will work, yet it‚Äôs hit or miss.

I‚Äôve noticed a shift in my focus too. Instead of concentrating on meaningful tasks, I find myself hyper-focused on random ADHD styled rabbit holes. Last week I somehow created a system that can illegally rip the code and asset files from any iOS app via macOS terminal. I forgot what the initial goal and task at hand was, and ended up doing that. Forgot to eat, or drink the whole day.

I'm beginning to question my ADHD diagnosis. Could I just be extremely lazy and anxious? I've read that ADHD medications might not work for individuals without the disorder. The uncertainty is overwhelming, and I'm considering if switching to Ritalin might be a solution, especially since 40MG is the highest allowed dosage for Adderall XR.

This really makes me feel lost and confused.

Any help would be appreciated. I‚Äôm worried to inform my doctor as well, because I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs just going to stop the treatment all together or not.

I'm a 25-year-old guy who recently ended a six-month relationship. After enjoying three years of being single, I came to a realization ‚Äì the single life suits me much better. The girl I was with was caring and beautiful, and we shared a great sense of humor. However, she wanted to spend at least four days a week together. While there's nothing wrong with that, I'm a massive introvert. 

Sure, I can be social, enjoy hanging out with friends, and occasionally hit a party or a bar, but I need plenty of time to recharge on my own. Committing to spending four days a week with someone, giving them 100% of my attention, became overwhelming. I couldn't help but imagine how challenging it would be if we lived together or got married. 

Now, I've come to the conclusion that I may never want to date someone again. I cherish my solitude too much. It feels a bit strange because many guys out there are desperately seeking a girlfriend, while I can easily have one but choose not to. (This is in no way a humble brag, I‚Äôm just stating the fact that the lifestyle is there if want it. Im more so seeking validation that being old and alone isn‚Äôt a mistake.)

1362,17d96wq,t3_17d96wq,Maniachi,I have recently started taking my medication again and have some questions,"I originally stopped taking the meds because I did not like the way I felt on them.

It was not only that I felt like I was too different from what I was used to, but it sometimes felt like I could not think properly. Like yes, I can focus now, but sometimes I would be thinking something and the thought gets cut off, as if my brain could not make the connection.

But okay getting off topic, this is not what I have questions about.

What I am wondering is, 1. Is it normal to get depressed on medication? This is the second time I started on meds again, and the second time I had a 'depression episode' (while not having had one for ages before that).2. Is it normal to feel sick and get bad headaches when on medication, on the caveat that I have not eaten (much)? For three days now, whenever I take my medication within hours I just feel bad and sick, and it gets better after I have eaten something heavy (like a burger or something). Eating something light (like cereal) does not help at all.I normally start of the day eating something light or nothing at all, but it is seems like I can't really do that anymore.

I don't have a doctor to ask, I am in a weird situation where I am legally allowed to get prescriptions, but I am not seeing a specialised doctor to monitor my situation (This is due to living abroad. I have a diagnosis, but I need to get rediagnosed here for some reason and then the referral can be sent through but the waiting lists are loooong).

When I forget to take them I lie in bed and dread going to work. I've been meaning to quit because I'm just so stressed out in that job, so that also goes into the whole deal, my mood will probably get much better when I quit but right now I don't have the means.

It feels like such a drag, and I know people with ADHD have trouble doing stuff they don't want to do.

I didn't expect to get these kind of side effects from the medication, is it because meds are naturally an upper or does it have something to do with adhd?

Hi all, I'm fairly new here. 
Not 'officially' diagnosed but both my psychologist and my gp think I may have it, and I'm getting ritalin prescribed. 
The medication help a little, my brain is quieter, I feel less anxious, more 'grownup' (I hope that makes sense), and when I start something it does not take 20 minutes (or more) before I can actually put my attention towards it. I can read longer texts, I don't feel super annoyed when doing a chore, I'm not having 5 trains of thought at the same time, I feel more grounded/heavier/quieter/less fidgety in my body, and feel a little less overwhelmed. 
That all sounds great, however, I'm still spending the majority of my days on the couch scrolling. 
There have been some big stressors happening the past few months, which are definitely contributing. Part of me feels like I just need a looooong vacation, but I also feel like I do not have the time to take it. 
Yes, burnout is the word. 
I used to be able to put in a LOT of work at the last minute, but now I cannot do this anymore. The stress that comes with that has me on the floor everytime. I've missed so much deadlines that the concept of 'a deadline' doesn't feel the same anymore (more like a suggestion).
I'm trying to work towards more consistency. The dream is to put in a little bit of work everyday, to avoid the last-minute-stress that's making me literally physically ill. 
But it doesn't seem to be working. Part of me longs for 'projects', for a few weeks of deep work with enough of a deadline that it makes SENSE to do it now, with permission to ignore everything else. 
It doesn't seem feasible. 
I'm so afraid that that won't be healthy for me. 
But what I'm doing now just has me stuck...

I'm an Engineer and project manager (as if one of those things was not enough). I like my job, and the industry I'm in, but I always feel like no matter my workload, I'm always really behind.  

So much goes into a project:  budgets, timelines, paperwork, talking to suppliers, holding meetings etc. 

With all that goes into a project, you need to be organized, proactive and plan things out far in advanced. That is just a single project, everyone on the team has 2-3 projects in execution during a year, and are planning 2-3 other projects for future years.  

I'm bad at organization. I've used sticky notes, one-note, several note apps, physical planners etc, but I always miss important things.  

My meds help to get work done, but also make me hyperfocus and overthink things. When my meds wear off halfway through the day, I might as well stop working because I can't get anything requiring focus done. If I do something I find interesting, I'll waste the day doing that instead of the boring *important* things. 

I regularly work 9-10 hours so I can get the work that my coworkers get done in 8. 

Long term planning is very tough with time blindness. Everything is a tomorrow problem, until I need things today.  

Interacting with coworkers, I can feel their frustration with me missing deadlines, forgetting/procrastinating on tasks, and making careless mistakes. 

I like my job, and if I'm being honest, I need to succeed at this for my own sake. My symptoms are a huge barrier to success, but I want to find a way to be successful despite them.

But even if a break would recharge me, it would need to be long. If I was focused and hard working for hours, a 15 minute break is not gonna recharge me nearly enough, right? The same way as, you can't use your phone for hours and then charge it back to 100 in just one minute.

I noticed that taking a break only interrupts my focus and afterwards I cannot get back into focus because then my mind has been filled by other things during the break

But on the other hand, what if I've been working for 2 hours and my productivity is rapidly decreasing and im feeling less and less motivation to continue? Would this make a break necessary or is this rather the sign that its done for the day?

The main reason I seeked some help for ADHD was due to executive dysfunction, but I am a little confused with that, because can't executive dysfunction also be a symptom of depression (or, long-term depression in my case)? 

My main symptoms of executive dysfunction (from either ADHD or depression, I'm not sure which), are:

* Jumping between tasks
* Forgetting to do things, unless I put it into my calendar as a task & schedule a reminder
* Not having the motivation to do habits (despite knowing that I should be doing them) until a visual reminder comes along. For example all day I remind myself to go outside and exercise, but I can't bring myself to do it until I look outside and see a pretty sunset, then finally I go outside to exercise.

I mean it's quite possible that I have both minor depression + ADHD. Or maybe I just have one. Or maybe I have neither and a nutritional deficiency is screwing with my brain.

The brain fog was gone. I was able to be in the present. Not everything felt overwhelming or overstimulating. I could do basic tasks that once felt so damn difficult. I could focus on things MUCH better. 

Within a single week I built up a tolerance to the 10mg that I was initially taking. Within the following week I boosted it up to 20mg. Within the week after that I boosted it up to 30mg. Now I'm at 45 and I'm not seeing much of a difference. I've been told that is a significant dosage as well.

I know that there are other options such as concerta, adderrall, vyvanse, non-stimulant medications, etc. But I find without this medication I can't get things done properly. I am always seeking highly stimulating activities otherwise.

My hope is to make an academic pursuit to University next year but if I can't get proper treatment for my ADHD then I'm going to find it very difficult to see academia as a tenable option in my life to get to where I want to go or to go to where I want to be. 

Is there anybody here who dealt with similar struggles in their lives due to their ADHD and the titration process that follows with finding the right medication to receive treatment?

I have been recently official diagnosed and I feel both relief and lots of grief and rage for the confusion of it and all the familiar ""what if"" feelings.  


What I struggle with the most though it that I feel like my visible symptoms aren't ""bad enough"" and I also feel like I cannot really explain or show them to the people around me, nor that I would even want to. In a way, no one in my life really knows how I *really* am (especially when I am feeling at my worst) and if they did, that would be a major problem.  


On the outside I seem to have my life together really well, I have had a successful academic trajectory, am stably and gainfully employed in a job that I love and manage to pick up other people's (especially emotional) slack all of the time.  


Sometimes I feel it's so unfair that no one (besides my therapist) really knows how much I am struggling, at times on an hourly basis, how many strategies I have to implement to keep it all running, how exhausted I am, how much I wish someone would *see* me and would care and would also be interested in supporting me, as much as I am always trying to support everyone in my life.  


I also sometimes read posts in this sub that suggest that people, who do not outwardly go through tremendous struggles, might not have ADHD. Reading this hurts and makes me really angry, because I  start wondering whether it's a race to the bottom then to get recognition, support and community.

And then they are like ‚Äúwow, you‚Äôre really broken and I don‚Äôt know what to do with that, so I‚Äôm going to distance myself from you.‚Äù 

And I try to explain what‚Äôs going on, but it‚Äôs definitely almost always an over-explanation and they didn‚Äôt sign up for that. 

And then I lose that safe, close friend.

I suppose I‚Äôm writing this to seek some understanding, maybe even another perspective as I found myself very very guilty and on the other hand, my partner was blaming me for 2 days about it and making jokes about this missed date to blame me‚Ä¶ 

Let‚Äôs give some background: We‚Äôve been together for 3 years and scheduled a spontaneous date during the date. Forgetting how much work I have to do (realistically!) I enthusiastically agreed to a date! And just 30min before the scheduled time I had to start working again and thought it‚Äôd only take me 30min. It didn‚Äôt. After 1.5h I realised the time, didn‚Äôt have the phone and smartwatch wasn‚Äôt connected to the internet. Tried to call him but watch wasn‚Äôt connected to the internet so well it didn‚Äôt work. I continued the work for another hour and then was able to get my phone (I work in the lab with living organisms so I‚Äôm pretty much dependent on their life cycle and everything). My partner was very disappointed as you‚Äôd expect but he carried on over one conversation (which in my mind should fix everything). I suppose the fact that he was angry at me, and making ‚Äújokes‚Äù as he‚Äôd go with himself on a date, or order the food which we were supposed to eat were hurtful.

after a while, when i should‚Äôve been at work already, i just gave up and asked my parents for help, panicking and not knowing what to do.

later, i get a text message, telling me i should call my work and ask for a specific manager. long story short, i managed to find the number, called them, and now i‚Äôm crying, thinking i‚Äôm losing my job. i just wish i had the courage to call earlier. to just try. but i am so scared of rejection i don‚Äôt even try, which always results in rejection.

1433,17cxu0w,t3_17cxu0w,PriorCryptographer70,Any advice for someone who is starting methylphenidate today?,"Hi all!

Finally posting after a few months of lurking on the sub.

I got diagnosed with Adult ADHD (combined type) a few months ago at the age of 28. I also have two comorbidities - Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Bipolar Type II.

There are only two ADHD meds available in my country - methylphenidate and atomoxetine. 

Due to the bipolar, my doctor initially wanted to explore atomoxetine for some time to see how I respond to it and try the stimulant later if necessary. While it definitely did begin to work gradually, and helped me do a lot of things which I previously struggled to do (even 'minor' things like showering regularly and brushing my teeth), the results were quite inconsistent and my focus didn't really improve - so the situation continued to take a toll on my personal and professional life.

Anyway, so finally I got prescribed methylphenidate by my doctor - initially a two week trial of
First 7 days: 5 mg in the morning
Next 7 days: 5 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon.

At the end of 2 weeks, I go back for a follow-up.

So, since so many of you folks have been taking the medication for years now, I wanted to know if you have any tips or advice? Anything I should do or maybe look out for?

It would mean I could say, ""Where's my flag?"" and, scan around for it, and have a visual cue to what I should be doing.

It could even have a white shiny base I could write a task name on with whiteboard marker, and remind myself what the task there was, if nothing was a visual clue to the task.

Instead of an actual flag, I could use a single colour of post it instead for this. Say, red. I set a rule that I am only allowed one red post it at a time.

1451,17cucgc,t3_17cucgc,AffectionateRide2934,Right hand-Left eye dominant,"I‚Äôve recently discovered my 8yo is left eye dominant, however he uses his right hand and left foot for everything. 
I‚Äôve been trying so hard to figure out what is going on speech, motor, and academically with him. I feel like an annoyance to his teachers and pediatrician. They say he just has severe ADHD (he really does, but even when on medicine, all it does is help him calm down and focus. It also gets rid of his stutter because his mind moves faster than his mouth can keep up). 
He‚Äôs been in speech since he was 4 for severe delays. Now, reading and comprehension of what is read is a struggle (understatement). Lowercase B‚Äôs and D‚Äôs get confused for each other. He will flip words in the sentence, or add words that shouldn‚Äôt be there. Skip several sentences down while reading. The same can be said while he‚Äôs speaking as well. Words added that shouldn‚Äôt be, present/past tense incorrectly used. He cannot grasp simple words like ‚Äúbefore‚Äù or ‚Äúafter‚Äù and many more. He‚Äôs been tested for dyslexia every year but always passes. 

His math is incredible, he could do numbers all day and has tested in the 99%. But now they are starting word problems, and without help would be failing. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do here. I‚Äôve researched and found so much conflicting data that I don‚Äôt want to bring up something completely bogus to his doctor.

I am aware that messing about with medical advice isn't the smartest thing so I just wanted to ask people on here. I've continued to take the 10mg dose as my current dose for the past 3 days and while my distractibility and hyperactivity have certainly become better, my executive dysfunction is still rearing it's ugly head every now and then.

I had been speculating I had adhd for a while, even gotten referred for testing at 20! But life gets in the way sometimes. I feel like me having adhd was swept under the rug for a very long time.

1475,17cos1q,t3_17cos1q,MrFabianS,Psychiatrist switched me to Vyvanse because Adderall was causing me to be tired in my days off. Now I have to pay $130 instead of $15?!?,"Hey everyone! I need some advice on how to proceed. I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type in late August at the age of 25. I‚Äôm someone who was always concerned with Adderall cause I heard of how addicting it can be so as a precaution I asked to start at 15mg instead of the recommended 20mg and was told I can take two days off on the weekends if it made me feel comfortable. 

After using it for about almost two months I discovered that my days off have become rough. My energy levels are really low and I struggle to get out of bed unless something fun, or serious is on the agenda. I was scheduled to meet with my Psychiatrist but due to personal matter they were unable to meet this month and recommended I seek another psychiatrist for a a refill (I‚Äôm using circle medical). 

I get on the call with the new psychiatrist and tell them that I would like to continue with the Adderall and switch to 7 days. They basically shut me down and said your body needs time to make its own chemicals and 7 days isn‚Äôt good for you. They switched me to Vyvanse without much input and said ‚Äúyou should be fine because it‚Äôs generic now‚Äù. They put in a script for it and basically ended the call. The call was about 5 min in comparison to the 20-40 min calls my other psychiatrist would do. 

My issue is that a 14 day supply of generic with insurance was $70 and a month was about $130. I can‚Äôt afford this huge price difference. I just wanted to switch to 7 days but now this has become a mess. I can‚Äôt message them and circle medical support is basically trying to get them to contact me. 

The script is ready but I don‚Äôt want to start a new medication with such a high cost only to possibly switch back in a couple of weeks. What do I do? Do I cancel the script and request a new psych or do I wait for them to reach out? I have 4 days left of medication with no solution in sight.

1494,17ckdlk,t3_17ckdlk,IndependenceIll8650,Starting Strattera - Advice Welcomed!,"Hello all! 

Looking for a little bit of advice here. 

I (28 f) got diagnosed with ADHD in 2020, I was prescribed dextroamphetamine at first, then switched to methylphenidate. Both seemed to have similar effectiveness, and it was amazing to feel functional, be able to create lists/habits and stick to them! But the side effects were pretty horrible with both. 

I had anxiety out the wazoo, feelings of impending doom, and one particular panic attack so bad that it made me stop taking ADHD meds altogether. 

SO I have been completely unmedicated since about July of 2022, and this is just not doable for me either LOL. I got prescribed Strattera over a week ago but I‚Äôm too scared to start it, lol! 

So my questions for those on Strattera: What are your favorite and least favorite things about it (as opposed to stimulant ADHD meds)? 

Also, when you first started it, how long was it that you‚Äôd been off your previous meds? 

I see Strattera gets a lot of hate for taking a long time to kick in/you have to wait a long time before you start feeling like a normal human again. But I wonder if that is just the absence of the previously prescribed stimulant causing those feelings of ‚Äúblah‚Äù/flattening.

For some context, I've never been diagnosed to my knowledge but I was in special ed classes from K-9 (although it was the upper level that teaches the same material but smaller classrooms for teachers to give extra focus on the students.

Besides ADHD, I believe I also have mild depression, mild social anxiety, mild general anxiety, and Dyscalculia. Obviously if it was more severe I would have sought help years ago (probably still should have) but now is better than never. 

I'd like to be tested for everything mentioned above so I can get my life to where I feel it should be. I'm not keen on taking meds but if adderall helps me maintain focus, even if its just for a few years then I'm fine with that.

I looked on my Insurances In-Network provider list and see mostly master level nurses, psychotherapists and etc. Wasn't sure if the usual chain is seeing a psychologist for diagnosis, discussing coping techniques and a game plan then being referred to a psychiatrist to discuss what medication or treatments might be best suited for wherever on those spectrum's I may be.

And I realized that when I gave myself a 20 min break and went on my phone, it caused my break to be at least 1.5x to 2x as long as I had planned. Almost always.

For some reason, I either can‚Äôt start work back up right away or I just feel like I need to ease into again before I get into the flow of things again.

When I looked into it, I found that it takes an average of 25 minutes to get back to focus after an interruption. Which makes sense and is terrifying.

But ALSO - one study found that those who used their phones during breaks not only completed over 20% less work upon returning but also took 15% longer to finish tasks after returning.

Shockingly, the study also revealed that taking a break with phone usage was almost as restorative as not taking a break at all. So yeah, it feels good to look at funny cat videos during breaks for a dopamine hit but it‚Äôs actually not restful for our thinking - if that makes sense.

What should I do instead? Some things I like to do: take a walk in nature for 10 min, engaging in deep-breathing exercises, having a conversation with a friend or coworker, stretching, or even daydreaming.

Before getting diagnosed I was going through a serious depressipm stage as I deal with a lot of clients every week and 8/10 of them either have unrealistic expectations of me or just give me more grey hairs every time I have to deal with them. Because of this I started thinking of ideas on how to not only leave my company (managers and employees are actually great and I get along with all of them, its always just been the clients who were my biggest issue) as well as the industry i work in (the 3 jobs i had allowed me to network quite well so moving to another company would just result in unnecessary drama)

However since getting on meds, I've had a substantial increase in energy and focus and even the clients giving me lip about not giving them immediate results or solutions doesn't bother me or affect me as much as it used to.

So now the only motivation i have for wanting to leave is money (while my pay is good relatively, I was raised by 2 highly successful parents who raised me to live by a specific standard) and at the trajectory I'm going at right now I won't ever be able to meet that standard by the time i retire

1555,17cb5d1,t3_17cb5d1,Narrow-Coffee2526,Let‚Äôs talk about music,"I (30F) recently got diagnosed with ADHD and always have had a difficult relationship with music, despite how much I do like it.

I could never concentrate on the lyrics the full length of a song, which made me have no clue what the song exactly was about once finished and that bothered me a lot.

Or I would find just one song and listen to it over and over and over again for months, on repeat, until I found a new song and repeat that cycle. 

I really began to love music again when I discovered techno a couple of years ago and I was obsessed. I didn‚Äôt have to think about lyrics, it was just mostly repeating beats and sounds, up-tempo and it made my undiagnosed (at that time) ADHD brain, really really happy.

As I mentioned, I just got diagnosed (about 8 months ago) and I‚Äôm on medication since the last three weeks. Since I got on meds,  I just can‚Äôt seem to enjoy music anymore. It doesn‚Äôt sound appealing (neither techno, nor my on repeat dopamine songs), nothing.

The problem with this is that I recently jumped into a new hyper fixation. I‚Äôm now in my DJ/producing era, but I can‚Äôt put myself to discover new music and I would really like to. And as I should if I want to grow into DJ-ing.

My unmedicated-self always wants to listen to one song on repeat and techno (also a couple of songs or live set that I really like, on repeat).

My medicated-self doesn‚Äôt seem to enjoy music that much. Spending quite some time finding a song that I like, listen to it two or three times and then completely turn it off because it doesn‚Äôt do anything for me.

It really sucks because in general I like music, I like music theory and love to create. Does anyone have tips? 


TLDR; I really like DJing and playing around in programs producing music, how can I get or trick my brain into discovering new music? 

Unmedicated self only likes a couple of songs on repeat, medicated self doesn‚Äôt seem to enjoy music that much?

I am really struggling with this part of my AuDHD... freaking thought loops.

What I mean by that, is that I kind off get 'stuck' on a topic (I don't think it's hyperfocus or special interest related), and I just can't get that topic out of my head.

I first truly experienced this with the topic of 'privacy' (please don't go there, lol... some rabbit hole that is), and I got stuck in it for a year or so. I felt absolutely miserable and couldn't think of *anything* else, it was always in the forefront. I did somehow manage to get myself out of that one, but now, you guessed it, the next topic comes lurking... gender identity (yay, another rabbit hole topic), confusing as heck (as I struggle with understanding my emotions enough as is).

But, my mind simply... won't let go. It's like it's glued stuck on the damn topic and can't really allow anything else in.

So, even though I still put in the effort to care for myself (exersice, eat well, sleep well (most of the time, anyways), socialize, etc.)), I feel generally sad because at every moment I have 'free time', guess where my brain goes... yep...back to that glued on topic, without ever reaching a satisfying answer/outcome/conclusion.

I was only diagnosed with ADHD recently.

So far I‚Äôve responded a bit well to Wellbutrin. It‚Äôs the first medication to treat ADHD I‚Äôve ever taken. 

I never suffered with attention issues, except that I craved stimuli as a kid. I was also impatient as a kid like I got into trouble for snapping my fingers at a teacher when I was 7. 

But I was very lazy and disorganized. If I couldn‚Äôt do something right the first time I‚Äôd get angry at myself and give up 

I was sluggish physically but I would talk and talk and talk.

I was diagnosed at 5 with Defiant Disorder and at 10 with PTSD but my parents never put me in therapy or got me any treatment or investigated too deeply. 

Anyway around the age of 19 what had been moderate but livable anxiety and hypochondria became severe anxiety and I was placed on Xanax. 

I was on Xanax from age 19 to age 30. My final dosage of that was 4mg a day. 1mg 4x a day. 

I (at my own discretion) switched to Librium, then got switched to 1mg of Klonopin 2x daily which I still take.

What developed in me over the past 3 years was‚Ä¶

Unless I am with someone (meaning like doing it with a romantic partner) it is hard for me to get into new things. 

You name it, new shows, new movies, new games. I haven‚Äôt been a gamer since the Xbox 360 era lol. Just the idk, ‚Äúattention span‚Äù for it isn‚Äôt there unless I‚Äôm with someone. The passion? Idk the term. Zest for life?

Like there‚Äôs a lot I want to get into but it seems overwhelming because of work and I feel like I missed out on a lot. I feel like almost like someone that was comatose. 

I feel my executive functioning has declined too overall in the past 3-4 years.

1577,17c7z2v,t3_17c7z2v,AloneYear,Is it just ADHD or is it also Autism?,"This one's not about me but my husband. He hasn't been diagnosed with neither so far but I am trying to motivate him to go and check it out because he has like seemingly the most typical AMAB ADHD, has been restless and disruptive all the time in school, couldn't focus on any lesson, was a class clown, very all over the place, got in trouble all the time and now as an adult he forgets things very often, is disorganized, can't remember appointments but can hyperfocus on video games.

But he also seems to have a few Autistic traits. For example, he has a special interest that he's been obsessed with his whole life which is music, he can research things about music everyday, listen to samples, read about the history of different artists, he has a milion playlists and knows everything about every song, he never gets bored of it and talks about it all the time.

Another thing is that he doesn't understand social cues and hints, He didn't realize I was into him for months even tho I made it very clear, calling him handsome, sending flirty pics etc. It took for me to tell him straight up. 

He is very empathetic but doesn't understand it when he accidentally does something that mildly upsets me. He doesn't know when I'm joking and when I am hinting that I'm upset until its too late and I get super frustrated(which I am trying to get better at)

He also has trouble with eye contact, and yeah I have ADHD and don't like to keep eye contact either when someone is talking to me so I can focus but I am aware of it being not socially acceptable and I mask a lot by trying to fit in while he always looks away when someone is talking to him or sometimes overcompensates and stares right into someone's eyes creeping them out a little. 

So we are both wondering if all the above warrants us to also try and talk to a psychiatrist about a possible autism diagnosis or do you guys think those symptoms still can fall into the ADHD umbrella?

my biggest problem with this is my inability to think and talk. due to my thoughts constantly jumping from one subject to the next i never have enough time to actually analyze individual thoughts to the degree i want to before they slip away and i forget everything i was just thinking about.
this of course manifests in speaking too. i take very long pauses and sometimes completely forget what i was thinking of mid-sentence. 
all of this means communication is very difficult, i have pretty much no grasp on it.

the only solution i've thought of is writing my thoughts down but that is an immense time investment because i forget what im thinking about, get sidetracked and also have to take the time to jot things down. 
it sometimes takes me upwards of 2 hours to write a summary of 15 pages from a fairly simple book.

I got through to the final round of interviews for this job that I was really excited about, and it was three sessions of panel interviews over zoom. 

The first panel asked a lot of questions about me/my background/my resume and I was absolute word salad the entire time. What is it about someone asking direct questions that makes me instantly forget everything I‚Äôve ever done??

Then we got to the technical panel and the first thing I do is misread the question and start answering it wrong. I got to the right answer eventually but I was so flustered and needed nudging from the interviewers because of really obvious mistakes. It was such a simple question in hindsight too which makes me feel worse. The other questions weren‚Äôt much better and I came out of it feeling very stupid. 

The third part of the interview I thought was going a lot better (pretty much all behavioral questions and stuff about my experience, etc). And THEN one of the interviewers asked how I managed to balance all my different interests and my dumb ass said ‚Äúadhd‚Äù !!!

Luckily he laughed a little bit and I tried to redirect into a real answer but still. I have no idea why that came out. Especially given all the advice about never ever ever mentioning ADHD until after you are hired and often not even then. Anyway, between that and everything else, I think it‚Äôs pretty safe to say I won‚Äôt get the job (they should contact me next week sometime). 

And now I‚Äôm just stressing myself out by remembering moments from the interview and cringing/rewording my own answers over and over again/twisting their responses into pretzels, so any advice on how to not do that would be very welcome üôè

College feels so different - much more manageable, very little anxiety, enjoying my classes / feeling much more present and in control of my time. But I've noticed that I'm less aware ? of time now - like I can focus on an assignment, and an hour will pass without me realizing -- but the pro is that I'll be  working consistently.

However, this has really affected how I take exams - while I understand the content, my time management has been completely off on my last midterms (to the point where I didn't even attempt problems that I knew how to do b/c of time).

In the past, I was pretty good about previewing problems and moving on when I couldn't do something. But now that I'm less anxious, I feel like my brain doesn't send enough ""MOVE ON!!"" signals. And then I spend at least ten minutes spiraling and panicking when I realize how much more of the exam is left. I'm a bit scared - since meds, my study habits have changed from ""clearing out my schedule, understanding every single detail about a topic before an exam"" (more ADHD-anxiety driven, since I used to struggle to get myself to study) to ""working diligently, blocking out time to study, gaining an intuition,"" but now I don't know how to take tests??

In BC, we have a public health care system. For children to be tested for ADHD or other neurological disorders, a doctor refers the child to a pediatrician, and the pediatrician determines if there is a need for neuro-psych testing and then refers them on. The child has no out of pocket expenses.

If an adult suspects that they have a neurological disorder like ADHD, they can go to their doctor. They \*might\* be able to get a referral to a psychiatrist, but there is no way to access the full neuro-psych testing unless they pay for it.

To me, this seems fundamentally unfair because we've already suffered for so long because we didn't get the testing as children, and it's not as though we're not still impacted by the issues every day.

I understand that there is a huge problem with capacity, but it still seems unreal that I can't get the testing without paying for it. I still have 25 years left in the workforce - isn't that enough?

I'm making enquiries to determine what specific policy prevents me from getting this testing. I can bring my issue to a quasi-judicial tribunal that doesn't require a lawyer, so there is a viable means of challenging the policy (once I identify it), but I don't want to go there if it's already been tried.

So, anyways, could it be a horrible idea to take my dose of Ritalin tomorrow morning as a way of seeing if that's what's causing this weird reaction?

Any time I try to start something, I simply cannot finish it. Why? I don't want to do the work it takes to finish it. The work = for me, that means constant migraines, brain fog, sleep deprivation, anxiety when i cant really keep up with the instructor or pace of the class, losing papers, getting so overwhelmed by two months in that i start to space out and skip classes. then i fall into depression. that's what ""hard work"" feels like to me.

and people are so judge-y about someone who ""won't work hard"".

so more shame. cue suicidal thoughts

1650,17rpc84,t3_17rpc84,Zealousideal-Tip7353,BOOK RESEARCH 1: ADHD and pain.,"Hello!

I‚Äòm currently working on a book about the ADHD experience. And I have a question for all of you first hand experts of the topic.

‚Ä¶ from my first burnout five years ago on, i habe suffered chronic pain. I‚Äòve been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety since then. I visited tons of doctors on that issue, but nobody could tell me what it was that hurt me, or what I could do about it. 

To describe the pain a little: it‚Äôs spread all over the right side of my body, beginning at the head, the sleeve, the jaw, to the throat and neck, upper back into the shoulder, down my lat and around the diaphragm and some issue in the hip and lower back as well. Also, there some weird tension in the back of my right thigh muscle. 

It‚Äôs never relieved really. No matter what type of yoga or exercised I did. So I just accepted it as a chronic comorbidity of my anxiety. 

But then I got diagnosed with adhd this year, took medication and the yearlong pain just vanished. It was a miracle to me. I couldn‚Äôt even imagine a day without it anymore. But there I was. Also, when i take a day off of meds, the pain reoccurred.

I also read some articles about it, so that I got really curious on that topic. It said it could be related to neuro-inflammation. 

So I wanna know what is your experience with adhd and pain? Are you often/constantly in pain? Do you see it as a reaction to masking/suppressing symptoms? Is it a state of exhaustion for you? Or an expression of emotional dysregulation? Maybe anger or despair? 

Pain can be interpreted or read in so many ways - i would be so glad to read about your take on all of this!

Not caring what others think (is it possible?). Like who cares what the guy on the other side has an opinion about you like you are not going to see him again. He can go fuck himself? Why care about his thoughts and feelings? Now the point of this paragraph is that is it really possible to think like that especially with adhd? 

Apathy/dissociation, nothing matters I feel numb and feel nothing to the external world and I only have my extreme emotions inside of me.

I‚Äôm going to try to keep this short, but basically I‚Äôm going in to the doctors on Monday to get an ADHD/anxiety test done on me.

Anxiety:
- Started over the covid lockdown. I‚Äôm now a university student, and there are times when I get such an intense fear of going to class I cannot show up. I‚Äôll just start hyperventilating in the library and then have to go home. That‚Äôs about the extent of the anxiety.

ADHD
- I used to be fine. As far as I can recall, at around grade 8 I was probably at my maximum focus. I could do my classwork for hours if need be (I was in extended French and the teacher gave us literal hours of work each night, shit was abhorrent for an 8th grader but I survived nonetheless). 
- I now find that I can focus for about 20 minutes MAX before I have to do something else. 
- doing something else usually leads to me doing something completely useless for about an hour or two, and the entire time I‚Äôm freaking out internally because I want nothing more than to do my work but I just can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like erectile dysfunction of the mind.
- I fixate on the most random shit for days, but I‚Äôve always done this part. About a week ago I learned everything there is to know about lava lamps rather than finishing my work. 

I‚Äôm afraid that if this isn‚Äôt ADHD or anxiety I‚Äôm just fucked. The way I‚Äôve explained it to people is that I feel like I‚Äôm on a decline. I used to be fine to just sit down and focus, but I think over the span of highschool my focus declined. I honestly cannot tell whats going on and I‚Äôm really afraid that if I don‚Äôt have ADHD im not gonna be able to find the help I need. 

I‚Äôm also afraid that being a university student, I‚Äôll just be disregarded by the doctor because they‚Äôll just think I‚Äôm trying to get an adderall prescription to abuse for studying.

Last year my psychologist and primary care doctor agreed that I had ADHD. Never got an assessment for it though since I was able to get meds and they significantly helped in all areas of my life.

Recently moved and have to find a new doctor. Went to a behavioral health center and was told that they don't think I have ADHD because I didn't have symptoms as a kid. I explained that my anxiety was even worse back then and my parents also kept me on a very strict schedule. 

But they refused to believe my symptoms were anything other than anxiety and even seemed to be heavily pushing depression just because my mom and sister have it. They asked multiple times if I am/have ever been suicidal (answered NO every time) and even ""what keeps you alive?"". Then refused to refill anything except my anti anxiety and told me that the ADHD meds were working for the wrong reasons.

They did put me on the eval wait list that is currently 6 months long. But, wtf?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17rk5ft/youre_just_anxious/,True,2023-11-09 18:55:38,False,9,False,False,6,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/17rk5ft/youre_just_anxious/

I always assumed this was related to ADHD, but I realised I should probably research a bit and ask the community.

The Army has been buying in wholesale into new age homeopathy instead of actual medical care because it saves money.  In the past when I tried to get meds for my ADD I was politely told to F-off, I also have had these so called doctors passive aggressively try to take away my anti anxiety medication on numerous occasions.     


Two years ago I talked to an Army doctor about ADD meds, I told him I had documentation from previous medical testing in 2004 and his response was that it wasn‚Äôt valid because it wasn‚Äôt done by the Army, he went on to say that he didn‚Äôt believe that I had ADD, depression or learning disabilities and wanted me to stop receiving medication.    I took this as a threat (which it was) and never brought it up again.  Then a year ago at a different base I talked to a different doctor about getting tested (*even though I knew they were going to claim there was nothing wrong with me)*  and only did it because my counselor kept badgering me to.      


Well they gave the run around and nothing happened.  Then a week ago I went to see a different doctor and he prescribed me adderall and it‚Äôs be helping me.

words cannot express how angry I am, because when they declare that I allegedly don‚Äôt have ADD that‚Äôs it, I have no recourse.

1716,17rfp28,t3_17rfp28,SevereFlorality,How do I know if my meds are working properly (and if I need a higher dose)?,"Okay, so the thing is: I am on Concerta 36mg. I am under 18 so I think the max dose for me is 54, which would be the next dose. In my country, there are only two stimulant: Medikinet (which didn‚Äôt work for me, because it wore off after 3 hours) and Concerta.

The 36mg IS working for me, but I don‚Äôt know if the extent that it‚Äôs working up to is good. Sometimes, I feel like the effects could be better, but I‚Äôve heard that you really shouldn‚Äôt up the dose if it‚Äôs not necessary. It has very heavy ‚Äúpassive‚Äù effects for me - effects that I only realize are there when I actually use them (I think that‚Äôs how meds work most of the time). When I don‚Äôt take my meds I just want to get up in the class, can‚Äôt focus almost at all and daydream VERY excessively, also think about hundreds of things in one minute, I make stupid mistakes, sometimes I don‚Äôt realize the serioussnes of the situation because of lack of focus (like I was staring for 20 minutes at my math test) and I can‚Äôt even talk about reading something.

With meds, I still make a lot of careless mistakes and daydream a lot (but not excessively and I can control that better), I can focus (it‚Äôs not automatic but if I try I actually can) and can actually read something without stopping every 3 minutes. Concerta works 10 hours for me, not 12, when it wears off it‚Äôs not that terrible (as in I barely feel it wearing off). Sometimes though, I feel like my focus still could be better, and on some days even though I have taken meds I feel like I haven‚Äôt.

He diagnosed me with ADHD but my weight was too low to be on stimulants and so I was prescribed Mirtazapine to help me put weight back on, which it did. When I spoke with my GP he said that he is unable to prescribe me stimulants as the psychiatrist who diagnosed me needed to prescribe that to me. But he still let me get mirtazapine through the NHS.

Fast forward to September, weight has increased but my ADHD is still untreated and I was having issues in work and my personal life. I saw my psychiatrist in two follow up appointments. One was to get prescribed stimulants and one was to check up to see how the stimulants were going, which was going well.. I shared the follow ups my psychiatrist took with my NHS GP. I‚Äôve been diagnosed, prescribed and had the follow up that stimulants are going well. The private medical costs are rediculous, having spent over ¬£900 in January and ¬£600 for the two follow ups.

After trying to stay off Reddit, I've started easing my way back into it.

A couple of things I've found that seem to help make it a net positive:

By far, the safest way for me personally at least to use Reddit is for direct questions to the Internet and reading responses to those posts that I make only.

The second way is eliminating recommended subs and only subscribing to a very very few number of subs.

(Sorry for possible mistakes english is not my first language) 


I don‚Äôt have any medication for adhd, I‚Äôm not officially diagnosed because of the price, I‚Äôm waiting to have a salary to do it! But I‚Äôm almost sure I have adhd, when I discovered it existed it‚Äôs almost like everything in my life made sense. 


One of my biggest problem is that always had so much trouble keeping a place organized, even small places like a desk at shcool (I‚Äôm in art shcool) I always end up with pencils everywhere, my jacket on the floor, papers everywhere etc. I don‚Äôt even know how everything ends up everywhere but it does. I‚Äôve been living alone for 2-3 years and my apartment get messy in one day, I clean everything and 24hours later it‚Äôs a mess again. I don‚Äôt even realize how I disorganize my place‚Ä¶  The worst thing is that I hate when things are not organized, it stresses me out, and the more messy my apartment is, the more difficult it is for me to tidy up. I end up on my couch, opening youtube and being almost ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù, I literally can‚Äôt do anything (it‚Äôs happening right now, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this sub lol) 
But it‚Äôs not only that I can‚Äôt clean but I can‚Äôt do anything, all those things I need to do are blocked in my head because my appartement is not clean‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt know if you have the same problem, it‚Äôs very tiring since I end up cleaning my place almost everyday because of how fast it gets messy. I wish I could just live in my apartment ment without disorganizing things without realizing it.

Let me start by saying I have not been diagnosed with ADHD but I have always demonstrated signs of it and have found advice given to those with ADHD to be extremely helpful in my daily life. 

One thing that I have always struggled with is remembering exactly when events are happening. For some reason I don‚Äôt associate the event with the actual day that it‚Äôs supposed to occur. For example, this Friday is November 10th and I have the day off. I am also leaving on Friday to go visit family. In my head those are two separate things and it takes me a while to realize that the two coincide.

It didn‚Äôt occur to me until my mom invited me to go somewhere with her on Friday since I had the day off. I was totally about to accept but my husband was there and had to remind me that we were going to be out of town.

I've got personal drama and professional trauma, which is not good for finding a professional job or my health (I'm 100 lbs over my preferred weight).

She understands the research and readings and social, economic, and political issues I mention, though, which is really nice. 

The thing is, though, is I wonder if this talk therapy is helpful or more just a waste of time. I haven't made much progress. I've made decisions that I can't act on and she's made me realize that I don't need to feel guilty for waiting since it's not really hurting anyone. She's also unofficially agreed with my self-diagnosis of ADHD. She can't do much for that, though. She can't legally say, yeah, let's put a label on this.

The small blue pill kind. I had no adverse side effects in terms of my mental state or overall mood besides that positive mood boost it can give you at times. I'm supposed to take two a day. 

Well, due to the strikes at the various pharmacies right now, I had to switch over to the pharmacy located inside the mental health services building I go to for therapy and see my psych. I guess at that pharmacy all they can give me is the extended release version right now. 

Here's the problem. I find the extended release is actually not helping and in fact is doing the opposite of what it's supposed to. It makes me panicky, I lose focus so fast and forget what happened two seconds ago, and when it wears off I crash mentally and physically but because it stays in your system longer i cant fall asleep when its time for bed.(I work nights so my med schedule is a bit different).  I absolutely did not have this issue at all with the fast release ritalin. I took it for about 5 months with no problem but immediately I start the extended release its like I may as well not take it at all.

I've always been a picky (and indecisive) eater and I often find the sensation/act of eating bothersome and off-putting, for no reason that I can identify. Food may look perfectly appetizing, but I just feel very little appetite and when I do eat, I often feel so full I feel sick/nauseous, or my heart may start beating faster.

As a kid i was told I have the wits to achieve anything in life but i can't even do my daily chores on my own.

Now a few weeks ago my therapist and I talked about the possibility of having Adhd. Once he sent me a book explaining the many faces adhd can have, I instantly recognised the struggles that were described.  It just makes sense. 

I got really lucky when making an appointment for the start of the diagnosis process.  Here in Germany you normally have you wait multiple months. For me it luckily just took 2 weeks.

Ive had 2 appointments so far. 

Nr 1. was an interview with the head doc/therapist.

Nr 2. were multiple tests, including tests for attention and short term memory for some reason. 

This Friday ill have the final talk with them where they will share my diagnosis.  

I struggled so long and could never pinpoint the source of all those problems that plagued me.

So I really wanted to get myself diagnosed but jeez is it expensive.  I also don't think my parents really looked into what troubled me either tbh.



So my dad has bipolar and a huge history of depression.  My sister has adhd and a lot of other issues.

Me? By assumption from my 22xl chromosome deletion,  intellectual impairment and learning disabilities. 


Over the years I've noticed I'll rather wait for something and stand there for am hour then be late not sure if that's because my parents yelled at me a lot. I'm also a bit of a scatter brain so my conversations are hardly fluent.

My depression happens in phases. I get easily distracted but I thought that was because I was a Martin most marrins are idiots sometimes im looking at dumb stuff my dad done.

I also get angry really quickly. 

Something I've also learnt I get choice paralysis   I'd rather play fortnite all the time then pick a new game.

I also get very attached to characters on TV shows so sometimes I have to quit watching something. 


And just the overwhelming anxiety and depression is just terrible.

1784,17r2qyh,t3_17r2qyh,morguoe,School is seriously killing me.,"I've never liked school, but I could at least pass my classes. Now, as a junior in high school, I'm failing almost everything besides Digital Art (because it's the only one I enjoy).

 I used to pride myself on my essay writing ability and how good I was in English class, but now that's my lowest grade. It seems like all of my teachers are slowly giving up on me and sometimes it feels like they look at me like they just know I have no future.

I try to do my work, I seriously do, but it feels like nails on a chalkboard every time I try to do it. Homework is the worst of it, because why should I spend even more time on something I already spent all day on in school? It seems so useless in the long run because I seriously don't see myself going anywhere in life. I've had teachers come up to me and ask when and if I will ever do their homework. 

My English teacher made me promise her that I'd finish a 10-page assignment by tonight, but what am I doing? Venting on Reddit! (I told her I would try, though. I didn't ever make the promise.)

My parents are upset with me, and I can't even blame them. They tell me that they know I have it in me to do the work and get good grades, but I just feel like they think too highly of me. I feel so helpless with everything. Is there any way out of this? Or will I be stuck in this hole forever? 

I'm medicated and I have a 504 plan. I have everything set for me, so why am I still failing? My counselor and my parents always urge me to use my 504 plan, but I never have. Asking for help feels impossible.

1785,17r2f5t,t3_17r2f5t,HaloFan239,Executive Dysfunction,"I recently got diagnosed at 22 in my junior year of university. The revelation felt nice that everything wasn‚Äôt totally my fault but still weighed heavy on me. I had heard of and sought the extensive list of coping strategies but none seemed to tackle MY issue even though hundreds claimed they worked.

I‚Äôve bought and checked out books on habit forming, motivation, ADHD, and of course executive function. In almost every piece of information they state that, to my understanding, executive function is the process of converting long term knowledge into short term memory, forming a plan of action and then reflecting on the situation. The key aspect most of that literature skips over the action part. So comes my problem and question; why does my body and mind not act on readily available information? 

For example: let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm making coffee. I know how to make coffee, the steps to run the coffee maker and what I‚Äôll do with the cup during and after the process is done. I know the materials in my possession, water, beans, filters. I am able to think about the benefits of making coffee and how it could benefit me. Everything in my mind is telling my body, let‚Äôs go make some coffee. But then my body stays still. It doesn‚Äôt want to act and in turn emits a repulsion at the idea of making coffee.

My issue with executive function tips is that my body does not feel the need to initiate those tasks which exacerbate the issue entirely. I‚Äôve just felt so lost despite my recent diagnosis. Medication is able to bridge the gap but I don‚Äôt want to be reliant on it. I want to understand the nature of this shortcoming so I can work around it and not be such a flake.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17r2f5t/executive_dysfunction/,True,2023-11-09 02:13:22,False,9,False,False,3,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/17r2f5t/executive_dysfunction/

I thought for sure I had ADHD, it seems so relatable. The Dr I went to said he doesn't think it's ADHD because I liked to read so much as a child. I'm not going to push it, though, because my mom has been saying for months she doesn't think I have ADHD.

""But Confident_Smile you said you got a diagnosis."" That I did, Autism, I was not expecting that one... Mom was...

When I look back at my short 42 years on this Earth yes FORTY-TWO(!), I can see it. That's all I've been doing since last Friday, processing and evaluating my life.

Doing research on Autism in women, apparently it is APPALLINGLY common that women are diagnosed into the 40's.

ETA: I just received the official diagnosis of ASD along with some expected comorbidities. This is what he has to say about why he didn't diagnose me with ADHD:

*There are a couple things that contra-indicate ADHD. There was no clear indication in childhood of ADHD or problems in a school setting, which would be expected with ADHD. Instead, she loved to read and did well in school. Also, her computerized testing with the TOVA indicated difficulty with cognitive flexibility, meaning that when the task demand changed, she struggled to readjust. She said it made her ‚Äúthink harder.‚Äù This difficulty with cognitive flexibility is more consistent with autism spectrum than ADHD.*

The TOVA indication seems to be the only valid indication. Maybe I should seriously consider a second opinion. Based on his report, it looks like I may have both.

**TLDR: I want to feel like I actually have choice over how I spend my time, not that I'm a slave to my dopamine addiction. Aka, a slave to avoiding suffering. I'm looking for help and stories of other people with ADHD, anxiety, and depression who have overcome deeply rooted unhealthy habits.**  


I'm a 33 year old man with ADHD and a history of severe anxiety and depression. I've overcome these struggles in some major ways and, in some ways, have a very blessed life. I hope to someday be a counsellor and help others. For now, some backstory on me and where I'm coming from: 

  
I was a high school dropout -- > I conquered my fear, finished high-school, and then went on to complete a sociology degree.   
I was afraid of water --> I learned to swim in the ocean.   
I was afraid of public speaking --> I designed a workshop series and taught it (sweating and terrified the whole time but i did it!).   
I felt like i was an inherently UN-creative person --> I started to learn saxophone.   
I felt deeply ashamed by how much debt i had and how I lacked money smarts --> I paid off my debt and read about financial literacy.   


The issue is that I have been medicating with screen time for most of my life. I just can't build good routines. I keep staying up late at night instead of going to bed. **Whenever I have free time I just procrastinate to avoid the feelings inside**. On the rare occassion I actually stick to my goals and resist easy dopamine hits, I feel so good about myself, but the routines are always VERY short lived (a few days if i'm very lucky/focused). My head is so messy (ADHD) and my emotions can be so intense (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) that I have a deeply established habit of going towards easy pleasure. I used to have a very serious video game addiction (10-16h/day) but I kicked that when i was 27 and went back to school. 

  
The thing is, my life used to suck. I had no hope and so, in some ways, it made sense to waste my time on video games and social media. My life doesn't suck anymore though. I have friends and a girlfriend. I have a job in mental health that I don't love but it's decent and it COULD be a stepping stone to a career I do love (I want to do my masters and become a counsellor). 

  
I just can't build good routines. I keep staying up late at night instead of going to bed. Whenever I have free time I just procrastinate to avoid the feelings inside. My head is so messy (ADHD) and my emotions can be so intense (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) that I have a deeply established habit of going towards easy pleasure. 

  
**I want to change my life though. Desperately.**  I want to change my job. I want to pursue a masters. I want to practice the saxophone that's gathering dust in the corner of my room. I want to be better with money. I just can't seem to develop enough of a routine.   


**I want to feel like I actually have choice over how I spend my time, not that I'm a slave to my dopamine addiction. Aka, a slave to avoiding suffering.**  


Do you have any simple suggestions on how I might work on this issue? Please keep your suggestions simple and practical if you can. I get easily overwhelmed by lots of information.

I'm not sure), I have sensory issues with noise and touch (again, I thought that that was also an ADHD thing?). I have issues with eye contact.

I started Strattera today (40mg) and immediately after taking it, I felt super funny. Had goosebumps and butterflies in my belly. Then, I started getting ready for the day and about an hour into my dose, it got a whole lot worse. I got super lightheaded. I had to sit on the floor, I used my boyfriends fitbit to check my pulse and it was at 97... and that's after sitting on the bathroom floor for 15 minutes doing nothing. He noticed my pupils were super large (super weird for a nonstimulant medication). 

My pupils went back to normal, and I felt a little bit better, I still had butterflies and just an overall ""off"" feeling, whew, now THAT'S over, right? Nope. We went out to hang out with friends, and it started getting worse again. Randomly, I started feeling twitchy, tears started falling out of my eyes and I wasn't even trying to cry or audibly crying. I had to leave and go home. It keeps coming in waves and I feel awful!

Is this common?? Or, does it go away after adjusting to the medication?? I thought this medication was going to change my life.. it made everything so much worse and I'm so disappointed and scared.

1824,17qxbuh,t3_17qxbuh,Equal_Ad_3805,"I'm chronically understimulated, what do I do?","I recently made a breakthrough in terms of understanding my ADHD. My partner opened up to me about some things that made her uncomfortable in our relationship, and it sent me down a spiral of really looking over my vices and why I partake in them.

I remembered a lot of videos talking about being mindful and observing how you feel before you take an action, and I realized - each time I engaged in those vices, it's because I needed something to make me feel...better. I usually don't engage in them when I'm sad or overwhelmed, I think it's just that when I register that I'm feeling understimulated by a task or even when I'm not doing anything, I just reach for those things the most (mainly porn, impulse spending, and eating lots of sugar, but it can be other things, like chronic scrolling).

It's usually a problem for me because it steals time from things that I REALLY want to do, such as draw more, make music, or learn a language, all things I find very fulfilling. Problem is, it's just more stimulating to consume content rather than make content or put in the effort to learn a language, and I often consume to take a break from something. (For example, I watch videos when I'm letting my hand rest from guitar.)

Looking at things from this perspective, I realize my brain is trying to bring me back to a 'normal' that it perceives. I'm unmedicated, and I won't be able to afford medication for a while (plus I haven't had luck with any meds when I COULD afford them). 

Does anyone have ideas on how I can best capitalize on this knowledge?

I feel no joy in the tasks I am doing after eating, and will sometimes resort to social media to get some temporary relief, because I am feeling so low, and my executive function so dampered.

I can‚Äôt just take time off and take it easy while I recover because that would risk my job and it would build up even more overwhelm because the list of things I have to do would get bigger and become even more urgent.

When I sit down to get the things done, it takes all kinds of emotional effort and sometimes cleaning (I cannot work in a messy environment. I just can‚Äôt) to get there.  By the time I‚Äôve convinced myself to do the things, my day is half over. On top of that, something that would normally take me an hour takes 3 because I am completely burnt out and my last executive functioning brain cell is in hospice. 

I use to have an attitude of ‚Äúif on my day off, I just have shit-tons of caffeine I can do it all in one day and tomorrow I will be free‚Äù but this doesn‚Äôt even come close to working anymore because of burnout. So I‚Äôve broken things down into smaller steps and have decided to shoot for consistency instead. But consistency wears off quickly and I‚Äôm right back where I was. 

I especially find it impossible to get even part of something done on a work day because by the end of the day I am exhausted and often in pain. At the start of the day I can barely function enough to get to work on time.

(side: nic cautionary tale),"So, asking because I might be going on meds next week (Concerta most likely as that's the go-to in my country), having been kind of anti-med in the past. I recently had a three-month bout of self-medication with nicotine pouches (stuff like Zyn or Velo). It gave me a great feeling of focus at first. Two months in and I got hopelessly addicted to them, with increasing dosages (6-8 pouches a day), decreasing results, and a constant feeling of fatigue. I quit cold turkey. I was straight-up depressed for a week, fortunately got out of it by now. Never want it to happen again.

Can anyone who had experience with both nicotine and ADHD stimulant meds (ideally not at once) share how different their experiences were, if the tolerance increased in a similar way, and if the addiction potential has been in any way similar? ""Clinical studies say"" that nicotine helps people with ADHD. My experience was absolutely awful. Maybe some of you had the opposite experience though.

It was from a private practice but I couldn't continue treatment and therapy with them as it cost too much. At the same time I went to my NHS doctor who put me on the waiting list to have an assessment with an NHS ADHD specialist. The benefit of doing this is that treatment, whether that be therapy or medication, would be significantly cheaper.  
Fast forward to October 2023 and I finally got to have an assessment with an NHS specialist. However, their diagnosis is that I didn't have ADHD but should see a specialist for a diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  
I gotta say this has really hit me hard and left me confused. In the year since having the original diagnosis from the private practice I have learnt a lot about ADHD, and adopting some of the coping mechanisms (e.g. buying a standing table, various fidget toys, regular walks) has really helped. I don't wanna say that ADHD explains everything that I've done in my life but thinking of certain things in this context has helped.  
But now I've been told that I don't have it and I don't know what to do.  
Sure, I will pursue the ASD diagnosis but my main worry is that I'll just get passed around different services and then eventually told that there's nothing ""wrong"". Even if the second diagnosis is correct and I don't in fact have ADHD what I do know is that I struggle with a lot of things that those with ADHD do and I need help!

Just diagnosed at age 30 with ADHD. I was started on 10mg Adderrall XR. First day I had the expected euphoria, but then went way after a day or so. I feel good overall like I was able to focus and calm down for the first time. No more low frustration tolerance. But then my 10mg I was taking daily did nothing for me or just making me tired. Felt like I was back to square 1.

Called my doctor after a week of doing the 10mg XR. (After a week it had no effects) They said to wait another week. So I did, taking daily but not getting any benefits from it. After the week I called back and reported the same. They agreed and bumped me to 20mg XR. 

First few days were awesome. No weird euphoria, just focus and calm. I was able to get more done in a weekend that I had the last 6 months. But it wasn't frantic, just calm and worked down my list. From my notes though I only got about 6hours of effectiveness.

Now today almost a week later with the 20mg dose I am productive for a few hours and it fades. From my journal notes it seems like every few days it lasts less time in my body. 

I feel so frustrated and defeated. The hope of it working and then being pulled away. Is something wrong with me? Am I taking my pills wrong?

This makes my ADHD even worse as  it exhausts my already very taxed brain. My job now requires switching between multiple interfaces and tabs and handling multiple small, tedious (but detailed) admin tasks endlessly. As soon as you finish one task the next one comes in and small mistakes can create big problems for multiple team members and customers. (My previous job, which included more project work and varied projects, was eliminated and I have been moved into a new role.) It is all really really hard for me. I also have to teach my old tasks to my new colleagues as well.

Almost all of my trusted colleagues have either been laid off during the restructuring when my department was eliminated, or are themselves on sick or burnout leave (including trusted managers or leaders). I have some coworkers I have talked to but they are all almost as stressed as I am, and they tell me just to do what I can to get through the day. But I am finding with my ADHD/anxiety combo that I am almost non-functional. Some days I am almost nonverbal, and have difficulty even understanding emails and requests that come in. This is **not** normal for me at all.

The thing is, I have a job interview tomorrow for a job at another company that, when I was feeling well and like myself, I thought I would be a great fit for and was excited about. But in my current headspace I feel like I am just lying to them telling them I can achieve anything.

Elvanse made me feel quite anxious, and Concerta doesn't. I was really surprised yesterday when I took my first dosage and the anxiety was gone. I felt kind of relaxed! But also bit slow. I slept full 8 hours which is a miracle. But today I woke up, took it and cried (?) without much reason (which is unusual for me atm) then I felt very sleepy all day long, and was also much more sensitive to noises.

I suppose it's doing new things to my nervous system but I'm wondering if it usually takes some time to adjust or if this tends to linger. Let me know if you have similar experiences. I'm still hopeful because now I realise how stupidly anxious Envalse made me feel (I even acquired a breathing tic on it). Also, I am taking less coffee like I did when I started Elvanse, but I do feel the need of caffeine... I'm wondering if coffee can increase anxiety though, even if I feel so sleepy.

I often have episodes when I just lose interest at anything and I can't get myself to do any work, even my hobbies or anything important to me and I get flooded with dark thoughts and feeling of being useless person.

I tried to handle this by remembering the positive emotions bound with these tasks or hobbies, ""you felt full of energy last time your exercised"" or ""people loved your art and you were proud of how fast you made it"", or watching videos or listening to music which once inspired me to do so. But it just doesn't work.

I feel the presence of these emotions, the joy, excitment, satisfaction, but they're more like in the background, behind the glass wall. They don't pull the strings the way to actually \*\*feel\*\* them and push me to do something.

I have no idea how to call this and what's the cause. Emotional disassociation? Paralysis? Numbness? Is that medical reason like low dopamine levels or maybe psychological like not believing enough in what I lived in past mattered? I can't even find posts or articles which could be somehow close to what I'm experiencing and this drives me crazy.

1897,17qmtmo,t3_17qmtmo,SevereFlorality,A problem with making mindless mistakes on tests,"VERY stupid mindless mistakes

Well, skipping on details is a symptom of ADHD, so I thought this might be a good place to ask.

I am actually a very detali-oriented person, but well‚Ä¶ only in things that I am interested in‚Ä¶ I think that says a lot.

This problem doesn‚Äôt really bother me in any area EXCEPT for school. Example from literally today:

I wrote my chemistry exam for 50%. I was crying like for 1 hour yesterday when I saw the results because I was so well prepared that I just didn‚Äôt understand how could that happen and had an entire mental breakdown about how stupid I am

You can only retake the test if your score is under 50% (C - D starts under 50%). 

I got the test today and I was laughing so fucking hard üò≠ I missed one exercise, I made a mistake of writing a - instead of + (even though I knew where the + and where the - is supposed to be, I just wrote it wrong), literally crossed out an entire exercise that I did RIGHT and wrote something in different order even though I knew what the order was supposed to be.

Because of that, I lost 25% of my grade. Like my grade would be a B+ (75%) if not that

My teacher (who is extremely strict) was so shocked that my grade was that low that she asked me how is that even possible and told me that I can retake the exam even though I don‚Äôt qualify for retaking it 

And it happens constantly. All the time, even. Once I wrote 2x6=2 on my math test, reread the equation 10 times and didn‚Äôt catch this mistake. The skipping of exercises also happens a lot, I am so occupied with what‚Äôs behind me that I don‚Äôt notice exercises that are short.

Or, on my FINAL (!!!) elementary exam I wrote that 225x4 = 1000 and ‚ÄúI am not going to check that because that‚Äôs obvious‚Äù. I would have 100% in maths if not thatüíÄ

Before I was medicated I even used to stare at my paper for 20 minutes and then realize I am supposed to do something.

You have to hit your brakes when turning through a intersection because the car infront of you suddenly seems to be creeping along instead of driving like they're supposed to.

1902,17qlwfd,t3_17qlwfd,Perfect-Effect5897,Life-changing study hacks,"Recently I found out a study/lifehack I wanted to share with you guys. 

Do you ever feel when listening to someone, your friend or a teacher for example, that they're *so slow* to get to the point that it's impossible for you to focus on what they're saying. It's like you decide to go on a jog together, but they meant a slow paced walk by a jog and you meant running by a jog. So you run, but you have to stop constantly and interrupt your runner's high waiting for them to catch up. (wow I'm literally describing a golden retriever) 

Anyway! I have found the solution to this when it comes to study material and lectures online: **1.5x - 2x speed.** Adjusting the speed erases that mishmash in rhythm completely! Try it. I have found that 1.75x is my ideal tempo for lectures or any videos for that matter. This has been such an improvement on my life, that it's ridiculous. The amount of times I beat myself up for not being able to concentrate is halved, easily. And therefore my sh ideation that stems from frustration from studying is almost non-existent. Most lifehacks don't work for me, but this! Literally life changing.

Now, I only have access to Medikinet through my sister, and since it's not working, I'm unsure of what to do.

1913,17qifgj,t3_17qifgj,Cool_Current8774,How to explain ADHD to my 7 year old son (I and his older sister also have it)?,"So, I have ADHD (and ASD, and C-PTSD from a brutal combination of an abusive marriage and work as a paramedic, but those are conversations for another day). My 7 year old son was recently diagnosed with ADHD as well. He‚Äôs in therapy (his mom isn‚Äôt wanting to put him on meds yet, which I understand but I also think it would help him). And he has an older sister (8) from a prior relationship of mine that also has ADHD (she‚Äôs medicated and it helps tremendously, it‚Äôs like having a different child when she is on her meds compared to off her meds). I also think he has autistic traits, but that‚Äôs a topic for  another day (he‚Äôs outgoing but has some really strong specific interests in numbers and dinosaurs, like he will just sit and write down lists of dinosaurs). 

He told me yesterday he knows he has ADHD, and basically he said that he knows it means he has a hard time with focus. Obviously, we in this sub know it‚Äôs not less than that but it is a lot more than that. He‚Äôs smart, he gets mostly A‚Äôs and some B‚Äôs, but I want to keep him going down the right path, and I firmly believe that educating him on his condition while working to correct problematic thinking/behavior is a major step in that.

Hello,  I've (30\~ NB) been officialy diagnosed last year\* after being 4 years on lexapro for depression and anxiety, and I know now those can go hand-in-hand if you don't have the right tools or support for ADHD. 

I'm tappering lexapro because I need to stay clean to understand myself as someone who has ADHD and I must say I feel great on a lower dose now that I don't have depression anymore. I don't get sleepy and I have the energy and will to go through the day :). The issue is that I FEEL MORE now, as I did before antidepressants. 

Yesterday I couldn't cope with the feeling of anger and I cut myself once to make it stop and calm myself. I was SO mad and I didn't understand what was going on on my head. I couldn't stop those strong feelings. Then I remembered I used to do that as a teen and in my 20ties. It wasn't a form to get attention, it was like the only way I knew to stop spiraling. Sometimes I just hit myself in the head or punched the bed... Little things I'm remembering now.

Is that a thing? I read something about emotional regulation difficulties. 

What is your experience?

Is there a way to cope with strong burst of feelings quickly in a more possitive and healthier way?

But is RSD something that happens as a part of ADHD, or is it something an adhd person is more likely to develop because we can be rejected a hell of a lot more than other people?  


If it is the former, then surely medication, therapy and other treatments would mitigate the RSD. But if it is the latter, then those treatments will help with ADHD but the RSD would remain...maybe you would have a better handle on it because you are not dealing with as many issues but ultimately...RSD being a learned set of behavior's  would require something else to address it.

Other objects, such as desk essentials, pens, and all that, it's easy. They just wear themselves out. You can't use them anymore. Towels? They look dirty. In the bins. 

But cloth? There are **tons** of choices. The "" I might wear them sometime. Keep."" to ""Oh it looks worn out. I'll use it as room wear."" and all that. 

Another thing, I just can't understand if I've grown out of them. ""It fits, but the sleeves might be short. Wait, what's the right length for sleeves? People might judge me if I'm not wearing right-sized clothing.""  It makes me anxious.

For me, one rule I have is that if the cloth remind me of unhappy memories during wearing them, I throw them away no matter the condition. Example: I wore this a lot during hectic projects, meh nah.

As long as I can remember, I have always loved visual puzzles, also have a mean competitive streak and frankly have explicitly trained visual processing all my life. Of course that test was fun for me.

I told my psych that I actually had fun and hyperfocused and he said, that that's just as relevant as a bad performance. Still. I (very likely irrationally) feel like I fucked over my diagnosis. Now I can only wait for his evaluation I guess.

Was diagnosed last year with adhd and bpd and was getting medicated. This year that doctor gets suspended and they take away my meds without any option for what to do next. Three months of withdrawals and medical bs later and I‚Äôm finally back on the meds. But it all just feels wrong now.

I know it‚Äôs takes some getting used to, but lately I find myself unable to enjoy anything. I‚Äôll sit down to watch a tv show, and end up staring at a black screen or scrolling endlessly without any real want to watch anything.

It‚Äôs affecting every facet of my life right now. Work is an overwhelming chore that I stress myself out to the point of vomiting. My gf is having trouble coping with me always ‚Äònot knowing what to do‚Äô and stressing myself out over that fact. My family think I hate them because I struggle so much to contact them, when it‚Äôs really that I just can‚Äôt cope.

Is this at all normal? Is this just adhd and the meds or is this something deeper? I just am not sure anymore.

it's the same thing with brushing my hair. my brain thinks i don't need to brush it everyday, because unless it immediately becomes a matted, tangled disaster it's fine.

orrrr stuff like personal hygiene. showering, washing my hair, brushing my teeth, etc. i'm not seeing an instant result by taking a shower. that's just something you have to do so you don't gradually become disgusting. so my brain goes, why should i take a shower right now ? i'm not visibly dirty or smell bad yet, and i can just keep on throwing more deodorant on! why should i brush my teeth right now? it's not like missing one day will give me a cavity

I used to be prescribed Generic Dexedrine ""Dextroamphetamine."" Then I switched to Generic Adderall.  I just looked on GoodRX to see what the price difference is between the two medications. 

I was absolutely shocked when I found 90 tablets of 20mg ""Generic"" Adderall for $25.51 and Generic Dexedrine - same as above (90 tablets in 20mg) for an outstanding price of $359.50 at Publix, $167.76 at Walgreens (Walgreens is the cheapest I was able to find it) I don't remember if I use to pay that price for Dextroamphetamine because it was over 7 years ago.

So, does Generic Dexedrine really cost that much? And why in the world does it cost so much more than Generic Adderall?

I am not asking for a ""professional diagnosis"" on the pricing difference. I am simply asking because I want to know if I am doing something wrong within GoodRX - or if Generic Dexedrine really does cost so much more than Generic Adderall.

I was formally diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago; over the last 10 months I've been trialling different medications with my Psych to see what works for me.

I started on 10mg a day of short acting Dexamfetamine (Aspen) and saw no change - no surprises there, it's a very low dosage.
I moved to 20mg a day and still saw no difference. I even tried 30mg, then 40mg a day to see if I felt *anything* different - but nope, still as distractable and unfocused as ever.

My Psych then switched me onto Methylphenidate (Ritalin) at 20mg a day and advised me to increase by 10mg per week to see if anything changes. Over the next few months I increased from 20mg a day to about 90mg a day and finally, FINALLY, I started to feel a bit more functional and focussed - not as much as I'd have liked, but it was something and that was nice!

Just had an appointment with my Psych today to share the good news - something worked! - only to discover that 90mg of Ritalin is *well* above the maximum recommended dosage (he forgot to mention that to me), and he unfortunately can't prescribe that much.

So, I'm back to square one of finding what works - I'll be starting on 40mg of long acting Methylphenidate (Ritalin) next week, but neither of us have very high hopes for it since the maximum dosage is still 60mg. If that fails, then we move to non-stimulants which we have even lower hopes for :/

Sucks to suck - hoping there's something else out there that actually works for me, but man, is this process frustrating

I went from a size 10/12 about 6 years ago to now being a size 18, obese and despite wanting to do something about it I can't stop eating and it seems impossible to stay consistent. I just feel like it's an impossible uphill struggle. 

It all lends itself perfectly to the BED with feelings of guilt and low self worth and self hatred, and self fulfilling prophecies just making me turn to eating even more and punishing myself.

These attacks don't happen every day (sometimes I can go 5 or so days without issue), but they do seem to be happening at least a couple of times a week (the frequency of these attacks has increased over the past year). Usually,  these attacks happen early afternoon 12:30-2:30pm range.

I've had an at home sleep study done, followed by an in lab study (overnight and MSLT), but nothing was found. I was basically told there was nothing they could do and to just take a nap if I'm tired.

I feel at my age, my only options are women my age who want to get married and have kids within a span of 5 years.

If I am gonna have a relationships it's gonna be one full of joy and spontaneity with no stress of marriage and kids whatsoever.

Pure fun is all I care about.

But the sad truth is, I am not a kid anymore. And I just feel those relationships people had during there younger days can't really be replicated anymore. All a relationship to me at this point is just responsibility and responsibility. Demand after demand. Errand after errand. And I'm at an age now where people don't really want to go out anymore. They have become entangled in their responsibilities and are over having fun.

While me, I'd party every weekend if I had the option to.

I just feel like a relationship just sounds dull at this point. And I would be better off being solo for the rest of my life.

If I multitask, it drains my focus and energy and results in zero productivity.

If I don't multitask, I lose my sanity. Every time that I have nothing to do for a few seconds, I get the urge to do anything active. My laptop gives me a 5 seconds youtube ad? Let's not patiently wait, let's switch to the phone for 5 seconds to then return to the laptop instead. I just cannot do nothing for 5 seconds. Its too boring to be nothing and it also feels so unproductive to do nothing, even if just 5 seconds.

I know its probably better to only use 1 device at a time, and only focus on 1 activity at a time... or even just 2 instead of 3... But when I limit myself to 1 device or activity, there will often be moments where I have to wait and do nothing for a few minutes or seconds, and those are so hard to deal with. I will feel like ""stop doing nothing, doing nothing is a waste of time"" where it doesn't matter if I'm doing a fun activity or a productive activity.

Every single second of the day, I have the urge to actively be doing something. For that reason, I cannot focus on the TV when im watching something, I will always be on my phone as well.

Is it even possible to get rid of those urges of always being active and always attempting to multitask? Or, is this just the way my brain is wired, forever?

Looking back, it ""improved"" my function, but only my ADHD function. Like, I was able to hyperfocus better, and I was able to be hyperproductive when a deadline was coming up, but besides that nothing really changed (maybe that didn't either?). 

I committed to giving it a fair chance for the 30 days that it was prescribed. So I fixed my sleep, diet, exercise, etc. I had no negative side effects, and it ended up not affecting me that much.

I saw my doctor 3 days ago and she gave me the choice to switch medications, or increase dosage. I did a ton of research before and decided I'd like to try other medications first, instead of doing the months of trial that could end up being useless. Not sure if this was the best strategy or not, but it seems like people are able to tell if they react well to a chemical pretty quickly. 

I've started on a low dose of vyvanse at 20mg. I also requested to shorten the time between appointments so I could avoid waiting 30 days in case it doesn't work sooner.

I'm on day 3 with vyvanse, and I don't think it's affecting me. I'm pretty sure the improvements should be pretty obvious. I was prescribed something when I was 14-15, and back then the improvement was was pretty cut and dry, like ""wearing glasses for the first time.""

Last month the generic was too weak. I don't have the name of that one.

* Who needs to eat/ drink?
* ANXIETY

I‚Äôm not the problem, and I never have been.   I‚Äôm 41, recently diagnosed AuDHD.  I‚Äôve been on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds since I was a CHILD - literally I was 9 the first time I attempted to self delete, and I have been on meds ever since.

When my 15 year old asked to be formally evaluated for autism to receive accommodations at school, I was sitting in the office with them and just nodding that yes, all of those criteria fit me as well.   I took the RAADS-R and scored 155.  The minimum score for the ‚Äòtism is 65.  In other words, I am autistic AF.  

Once I figured that out, I started looking at the accommodations Kiddo was asking for in different situations, and I started applying those same tools to my own existence, and the difference it‚Äôs made has been astounding. 

I just went on a five day trip with a friend, in a car/sharing a hotel room, and I didn‚Äôt melt down At All.  I was able to say ‚Äúhey, I need 20 minutes of being alone to recalibrate‚Äù and ‚Äúthis space is too much for me, I‚Äôm gonna go over there, you take your time and come get me when you are ready for the next thing‚Äù and it was awesome.  I had such a great time, and miracle of miracles, we are STILL FRIENDS.  

It‚Äôs not me, I‚Äôm not the problem.  I‚Äôve been trying to exist in a world that wasn‚Äôt meant for me, so of course I‚Äôve been struggling.

I‚Äôm tapering down my meds, with the goal of being completely off them by the end of 2024.  I‚Äôm being very cautious because I‚Äôve had mania in the past, but this doesn‚Äôt feel like that - this feels steady, stable, content.

I got diagnosed about 6-9 months ago (i guess not that recent lol) and got prescribed stimulants about 3 months ago.

Going to therapy was great, but also extremely confronting since i now know exactly why i've always felt like something was wrong with me. It's a bit of a double-edged sword.

However, the last month i have been a bit depressed, and it seems like this has heightened some symptoms that (i believe) come with ADHD, like ignoring/not tending to relationships, not being able to focus on work, feeling unable to do the stuff that matters. I've been trying to just plow through it and get stuff done, but it's been very tiring. It feels like i have a backlog of thousands of thoughts and responsibilities in my mind, and it feels incredibly overwhelming.

I've also noticed my ADHD has impacted my relationship with current GF a lot, and it has made me feel almost inferior in the relationship, because a lot of things that matter to my GF seem to be things i struggle a lot with. I also don't want to tell her that some things i do/don't do are linked to my ADHD, because i feel like she will think i'm just blaming my condition instead of taking responsibility (and i also somewhat feel like blaming my ADHD = absolving myself of responsibility).

I guess TL;DR:

How does one learn to deal with all these things, the feeling of being inferior, beating yourself up over not being able to do the things you should etc. I'm hoping this will get better over time, but i want to find ways to actively learn and get better at managing my ADHD instead of just hoping it will get better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17q0rxf/recently_diagnosed_need_some_words_of/,True,2023-11-07 18:25:03,False,3,False,False,3,0.81,/r/ADHD/comments/17q0rxf/recently_diagnosed_need_some_words_of/

Since then we‚Äôve been playing the dosage dance to figure the sweet spot.  In complete honesty- this is extremely stressful for me.  I don‚Äôt know what to look for and I don‚Äôt know when ‚Äúenough is enough‚Äù. We had one try where he went from 2.5 mg to 5 and that I noticed was too much.  He was stimulating lol could t stop talking and EXTREMELY emotional.  We switched to adderall xr and he‚Äôs been good on that.  He‚Äôs currently at 15 mg but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs enough.  

A bit of a background.  My son is so smart‚Ä¶ exceptionally so.  It wasn‚Äôt his grades that made me notice he needed evaluation.  He struggles socially, and I‚Äôd say very much struggles.  He cannot sit still, fidgets non stop (picks his skin a lot) and is a big non stop talker and highly emotional.  

Back to the medication‚Ä¶  I notice he‚Äôs less talkative on vs off, but not in a very noticeable way.  He‚Äôs a bit less emotional too.  He still fidgets non-stop and moves a lot still too.  I don‚Äôt see him picking up on social cues at all and haven‚Äôt seen drastic improvements in friendships.  He still needs constant reminding and bringing back to focus.  What I do notice is he barely eats.  

Does this mean we should maybe move to 20 mg? Is the things I‚Äôm not noticing a change in just something that will take some time? He started medication in August.

My doctor was really nice about it and said that they would just need the records from my therapist. So I requested my records and received them today. 

No where in the session notes does it discuss me having ADHD. It discusses my anxiety and difficulties completing tasks. But nothing about ADHD. There is also an evaluation that I did, but on the report it explicitly says ‚Äúthis is not a diagnosis‚Äù. I‚Äôm feeling awfully anxious and embarrassed by this. I‚Äôm nervous my doctor is going to think I‚Äôm just trying to get drugs or something. Should I submit these records? Should I explain the misunderstanding to my doctor? Should I abort the mission all together? I was really excited to finally get the help I need and be able to function. Especially at work where my inattention causes me a lot of stress.

I had been taking Elvanse for more than one year but it was such a bumpy road... I felt terribly slow, socially anxious and groggy at first even at 30mg, then weird, then depressed when the dosage was increased, then I had to lower dosage to a minimum to make it bearable to my mental health and still dealing with a lot of anxiety, which I thought was normal. I know it sounds awful but it was still better then nothing just because it helped me get up in the morning and be a bit more functional. My doctor once suggested moving to Concerta but I was really afraid of wasting a lot of time again to adjust to it because Elvanse took me months and everyone says so much about Concerta anxiety that I was honestly afraid.

Anyway! Due to the shortages here I am, taking Concerta, just 18mg. And well, it does seem ok? I'm very sensitive to medications in general so even low dosages have an effect on me. It's only my first day and I do feel a bit slower but also relaxed, and no longer physically anxious as I was when I woke up. So far so good. No side effects for the moment, although it is still too soon. Something weird is that I seem to be more hungry than usual. It's funny that the day suddenly seems to have more time??

I fully acknowledge how irrational this sounds, but I'm scared that starting medication might prevent me from having these windows of passion and that my creativity may be stunted.

I'm wondering if any other people who have strong passions for things that they engage with regularly in life (whether it be in the arts or anything else) have found that starting medication changed the way they interact with their passions.

I'm well aware Reddit is not a replacement for seeing a doctor. I'm simply wondering what is classified as ADHD and what is not. When is it ADHD and when is it just being human?

Are these symptoms of ADHD?

- Difficultly following through on plans and commitments.
- Difficulty being on time for meetings.
- Difficulties with taking responsibility for almost anything.
- Chronically disorganized, misplacing things, etc can never find keys/phone/wallet or similar when leaving from home.
- Forgetful
- Extreme problems on focusing on one task
- Extremely easily distracted
- Extreme problems with procrastination 
- Bordering on impossible to get to bed on time and stays up all night playing games/watch series. Even with work starting early next day.
- Making grand plans and never being able to follow through on them.
- Difficulty stopping oneself from short term gratification; eating treats/drinking alcohol etc.
- Difficulty to recognize own feelings or state of mind, like a disconnection.
- Avoiding anything that is not fun and constantly postponing chores.

Are these symptoms of ADHD? ADD? Or something else..?

Hi people, I am using Sertraline for 2-3 months, my doctor first wanted to see if was some Anxiety disease, before trying something directly to ADHD, I took one pill in the morning for one month, after that my doctor increased the dosage to 2 pills, one in morning, one in evening. She said if the Sertraline didn't make significant impact, she would try Bupropion, this was one month ago and my next meeting with her it's in 2 days.. Here where I live, Atomoxetine was only liberated to selling last month (after my last meeting with my doctor) and didn't arrived on the pharmacy yet, this will probably happen in the second half of this month.
So, my question is, which one should I try to talk with my doctor to make a test? Atomoxetine and wait a bit to buy or try Bupropion?

I'm sure many of you can relate to that.

After starting meds I noticed how starting and finishing tasks isn't what it used to be, they are not these mentally draining hard tasks that I avoid to do because they are so exhausting. Now it's just me doing tasks because they have to be done. 
I was always told I am lazy and just needed to put more effort into it.

No one realized that I put in ALL of my effort and willpower into it, hell I would even say I have more motivation/willpower than other people. But all of that didn't help me because my brain was just working against me. 
Now that I don't have that mental barricade I can do so much stuff. I don't get hung up on small things and stop things mid way because of frustration, doing the dishes or laundry doesn't feel like I have to give up a weeks worth of energy, going to work doesn't feel like hell, talking with coworkers used to make me so upset because they only talked about boring stuff, now I can just have smalltalk with them and actually enjoy it, my social anxiety is almost conpletely gone and I don't overthink stuff. It's just so different than before, I'm not even sure if I can better concentrate on stuff, so I don't know if they work as they should but they do something with me so I guess thats good enough. 

It makes me happy but I also mourn, I don't know exactly why it makes me sad and upset, probably because I've been told all my life that I just needed to have enough motivation, just to realize that has been bullshit all the time.

I got a new telehealth prescription for dex and I saw my psychiatrist has cancelled my prescription for Ritalin (which is totally fine with me I have all the scripts I just don‚Äôt take it.

2089,17pnic7,t3_17pnic7,D-Shap,Question about disclosing ADHD in a job interview,"I am looking to apply to jobs in the field of UX design. I've been putting in a lot of effort into building a strong portfolio and resume, and I am almost ready to begin interviewing.

During interviews, I may be asked to present a case study from my portfolio. I have 2 case studies that have nothing to do with ADHD, but my strongest case study is about an ADHD-focused app that I designed to help people like me manage executive functioning. 

I'm really proud of my work, and many of my initial ideas for the project came from years of thinking about possible solutions to problems that I personally struggle with. But, if I present this case study, the first thing I have to do is explain why I decided to design this particular app. The answer is at least partially due to my own struggles with ADHD. 

Here is the dilemma. I understand that there is still a lot of stigma and misinformation about ADHD, especially in the corporate world. That being said, if I can't present this case study in an effective way because I can't bring up what actually motivated me to do it in the first place, then I lose out on presenting some of my best work.

What are yall's thoughts? 

Is it worth it to reveal my previous struggles with ADHD in order to effectively present my best work? Or should I avoid discussing that case study completely? What if they explicitly ask about it? Is there some middle ground where I can talk about the project without discussing my ADHD at all?

Also, as a potentially relevant side note, I did successfully graduate from college with a good GPA (before my diagnosis). Since they have my resume, they should know that.

Does anyone know which European countries have the most accessible adhd treatment? 

I‚Äôm planning to apply to graduate schools in Europe within the next few years and something that‚Äôs important to me is being able to continue using stimulant medication. Also, I know that there are a lot of countries where stimulants are legal, but where it‚Äôs very difficult to find a doctor that will prescribe them because it‚Äôs just not culturally accepted (France, Hungary are some examples). 

So my question is less about legality and more about how easily accessible treatment truly is.

 I already have a diagnosis (usa) so I‚Äôm not necessarily waiting for that, though I‚Äôm not sure if redoing all of that is required in certain situations.

Basically, as an art student, I don't have a lot of free time. Most of my evenings are spent getting through homework as fast as I can while I pursue other creative interests, such as writing, 3D modeling, and (even more) drawing. 

For my routine, I usually get home from school at 4 then have around 3 hours to do each then I play games with my friends. This is ideal for me on paper but I struggle to keep up. 

I want to do all of these things well, even professionally at some point, so I have set goals of getting an hour of each done per day. Yet I've been going for a week and so far I haven't been able to do even two consistently per day; say I draw and write Monday, the next I'll 3D model and draw, then Wednesday I'll write only, etc etc. 

The only time I've gotten all 3 done is when I've ignored my friends requests to ""hop on the game"" and I only spent about half an hour on each, and another where I spent 4 hours stuck on drawing instead of doing the other two as well.

2125,17phj0i,t3_17phj0i,_iprocrastinatealot_,My schedule is in shambles and I'm going insane overall,"Some background context first: I study abroad away from my home country, and live on my own in my room in student housing. I've been living on my own like this for technically 2 years (give or take), but I've had to move rooms 4 times due to a housing crisis and I don't feel happy living in this country. I have also had a study delay courtesy of ADHD and other coping difficulties and I'll finally (hopefully) finish my degree in January and will move back home soon. 

But nonetheless, I have to stay abroad for now and my schedule is AWFUL, extremely all over the place. Ever since the pandemic my sleep schedule has been going past 1 am and it has now cemented my circadian rhythm in such a way that I physically can't sleep before 3 am. And I'm so used to it now that I don't even know if I know how to or even want to sleep before 3 or 4 am. I wake up at 1 pm or later and eat ""breakfast"" at 3 or 4 PM and lunch at random times in between (if I even eat lunch) & ""dinner"" at 1 am. 

It used to be better earlier, because I'd atleast eat dinner before 12 am, and wake up a bit earlier, but the past 2 months, it's been getting worse again. I also hate cooking and grocery shopping and can't bring myself to do it so I naturally cook late too. 

And to top everything off I have some health anxiety so I'm constantly worried about the food I'm eating. And since the weather is changing and I have less classes at uni now, I'm losing it. I don't know what to do. It feels like the schedule and the weather and my constant lack of functioning and loneliness is piling up on top of me. I don't even know why I'm writing this here, just wanted to vent and maybe see if someone else also faces a similar issue perhaps? Just looking for some support and solace I guess. Sorry if I wrote too much oops.

The issue I have is with the cyclical up and down mental/emotional impact. After an hour or so at peak I'm feeling overly optimistic and excited which then leads to the disappointing drop about an hour later. It's not ""euphoria"" and ""depression"" per se, just a sense of ""can do!"" followed by mild ""disappointment"" and some fatigue.

In the ""up"" portion I'm productive but too willing to go down a rabbit hole or reach out for some social connection online (sharing links, making plans, etc) that I'm not quite as beguiled by once I level out. 

In the ""down"" portion I start to struggle with clarity of purpose and motivation. Not huge, but enough that it's an exhausting thing to go through up/down 3x a day.

I've tried different meds but Ritalin has the overall best success with me so far (though my doctor is eager for me to give Vyvanse a try once it is finally available in the next year or so in the country I live in).

2145,17pdzhv,t3_17pdzhv,what_the_a,Minor Rant: the concentration playlist I've used for years was changed and it has completely thrown me off.,"I've been listening to the same concentration playlist on spotify for like five years. It's perfect -- all the songs have no or minimal vocals, it isn't classical music, it's upbeat enough to keep me going but mellow enough that I don't get overstimulated. I basically now have a Pavlovian response -- as soon as I start it, my brain kicks into ""work"" mode. By song 3 or 4, I am in the zone and the music fades into the background. It's been old reliable for me on especially rough executive function/distraction days.

Recently I hit play and the song I was expecting didn't play. I checked to see if I had hit shuffle or started somewhere later in the playlist. Then I see it -- whoever created this playlist added new songs or rearranged them. I can't remember the exact song names or order from before because it never really mattered to me -- I just knew I liked it and it worked. Now it's different and I can't fix it. It completely derailed me today. I feel genuinely upset.

I know this isn't really a big deal in the grand scheme of things but when you have a tool that works and it suddenly goes away or changes, it's so disruptive. I told my partner about it and he was understanding but he doesn't have ADHD so I don't think he could really fully understand how disappointed I am lol I know you guys will understand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17pdzhv/minor_rant_the_concentration_playlist_ive_used/,True,2023-11-06 21:43:04,False,2,False,False,2,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/17pdzhv/minor_rant_the_concentration_playlist_ive_used/

2149,17pdc1k,t3_17pdc1k,mott_street,How do I deal with my cluttered storage unit?,"I live in a tiny studio in Brooklyn, but still have a storage unit in Manhattan when I used to live there, filled with a lot of random items.

The storage co keeps increasing the rent, from $50 to now $110, which is starting to feel absurd. My goal is to declutter to the point that I can just not rent a unit at all. But I'm struggling to figure out how to deal with the stuff that's in there right now. As someone with ADHD it just feels overwhelming.

I'd say 50% of the stuff in there are small random items I was planning to sell. But I would need to photograph/list the stuff and don't have room in my studio to bring everything home. Even if I could photograph the stuff in the storage unit and leave them there until someone buys it, it would feel silly to make a trip to the storage unit each time someone buys something - most of the items aren't worth a ton.

The other 50% are things that ""might be useful someday"".

I could just move everything to another storage unit and deal with it here, but all the units near me (Brooklyn Heights) are even more expensive, and the thought of coordinating a truck to move everything also gives me dread.

Other options would be to just give away or throw away the items. But that also feels like a huge waste.

There are so many important, urgent, interconnected, things that even thinking about it is overwhelming. We'll make a shared to do list on an online task tracker but it's massive, hard to prioritize, and we never really come back to it. Same with a written list that we might put on our fridge.

We've started taking our personal calendars more seriously and sharing them with each with mixed but promising results. 

The phone is as much a blessing as it is a grenade. My partner's Apple Watch has helped her manage her work calendar better without falling into the dopamine wormhole and I'm taking the Apple plunge and getting an iPhone and Apple watch myself. 

I'm very excited to get phone-free calendar reminders from Apple Watch as well as get new tasks/thoughts off my mind by using Siri to add to a central list.

I‚Äôm hoping y‚Äôall could help answer this question I have. So, Normally I have an incredibly hard time starting and focusing on tasks even with my medication. I‚Äôll constantly tell myself I‚Äôll start it later, one more video, but I rarely ever actually get started. And if I do even get started, I find it insanely difficult to focus on whatever work I‚Äôm doing. 

However, recently l've noticed that if I stay up all night, I become a fucking machine over night and throughout the next day. While a combination of taking my medication and sleep deprivation makes me the most efficient, even just the sleep deprivation on it‚Äôs own feels more effective than my meds. I'm easily able to start tasks I need to get done, I‚Äôll think ‚ÄúOh I should probably do that,‚Äù and then I‚Äôll just do it!?

Obviously I don‚Äôt want to purposefully sleep deprive myself just to get work done, but sometimes I feel like I‚Äôll have so much shit built up that I have to do that my only option is to stay up multiple days in a row so I keep focusing and getting my work done.

when i take it, i get this serotonin/dopamine rush, where i suddenly want to do everything once it hits. not just clean my room or do my work, but also plan a trip with my friends, go to a concert, do my makeup, text a ton with people, etc. stuff my usual self wouldn‚Äôt love doing, but suddenly i want to do it so much my heart feels like its full? im a lot more impulsive, and feel out of breath sometimes just from the thoughts. as great as it is to feel what im assuming is extreme happiness and excitement, its overwhelming. 

then, after about 20 minutes of that, i feel so incredibly hopeless that i almost feel nauseous. its really hard to describe these things, but the high happiness and low hopelessness alternate every 5-20 minutes.

all of these feelings were happening on my lower doses, just at slightly less of an extent. i had to raise my dose because i still couldn‚Äôt focus a ton, but now on this dose i find i focus well.

I already have received a diagnosis from my wonderful therapist (she is also a late DX woman so she just GETS it), which will either make things easier or harder with my doctor. He likes to feel like he is the smartest in the room, and can be good if he has come up with an idea, otherwise is dismissive, rude, and misogynist.

To add to that he has a bad track record when it comes to mental health... He found out a friend has anxiety from her file and made her re-do the assessment, only to tell her that ""a little stress is healthy"" when she scored in the upper ranges.. I also wonder if he is anti-ADHD medication because he immediately jumped to ""stop taking your Vyvanse"" when my friend had heart palpitations.. even though no doctor she has seen after has said so, even the cardiologist. But I know he can just jump to conclusions - so maybe he thought he had found an easy answer.. 

Switching doctors isn't an option at the moment.. I live in a smaller city and no other doctors are taking patients

I read a post earlier and wanted to reply from a meds point of view. 

Then I read another thread from a female about premature ejaculation. 

So I thought I'd share. 

I'm male. 

The increased libido effects off stimulants are very relative. So by  nature of being a stimulant (increased sensitivity, alertness, and general energy and motivation with intent) cortisol levels increase and move better. 

So they would all increase labido and SENSITIVITY. 


The guys who get the opposite effect, that's just a negative side effect of the drug. 

Increased sensitivity, increased alertness etc. 

Increased irritability, increased general feeling of stress. 

So the research says focus on the negative symptoms and see what you can do to reduce them. Mediation, breathing, music. All that mindfulness jazz. 


Anyway, I'm male. Had sex anxiety and been premature for ever. I found by accident sertraline solved it. Turns me into a stallion. Anyway, 5 years on. I've had to come off. I found that I was always withdrawing from sertraline (short half life). Emotional messiness. But mostly I developed a psychogenic itch. Had it that long I thought it had always been there.

So I'm a few months into my Wellbutrin-Vyvanse combo and it's been working great. Most parts of my life have seen improvements. The one that's seen a negative reaction is work.

I am a trucker. I'm kind of stuck in this career for at least 2 more years. So I'm trying to find the highest possible paying position to offset my newfound disdain for this job.

I've been applying for Alberta oil field jobs, since most pay 50% or more than what I make now, with a relatively better work life balance. The one I really want is 50% more annual pay with more than double the time off, working a 21 days on/14 days off rotation. But here's the snag- it's deemed a ""safety sensitive position"" and will require a 5 panel drug test to get hired.

Obviously Vyvanse is an amphetamine and it's going to show up. Will this automatically disqualify me from the job? If I tell the employer before taking the test that I'm on meds, will that change how the results are viewed? Will that eliminate my chances before I even take the test?

I've been applying like crazy, calling HR reps (and I fucking hate talking on the phone) and trying to get some training certificates to set up for this switch. Realizing my meds may make it impossible to get hired has me worried though.

Has anyone dealt with this before, as the employee or even better, the HR side, and have any tips?

For months I've been meaning to make another appointment with my psychiatrist or at LEAST email him, but of course, that's """"too hard"""" for me. I've been out of medication for months and even though I could just email him for another script, I just can't.

I grew up loving music and singing, I was a huge lady gaga fan as a child (still am, little monsters rise up!) and I was given every opportunity to learn and was gifted every instrument my hyper fixation at the time desired. I had pianos, keyboards, violin, guitar, i went into lessons for all of them but in the end I got so bored and tired I found no motivation to keep going. As an adult, I see so much wasted potential, I could have learned so young how to play so many things and gain the tools I needed to be successful in something I have always loved. I danced as a child as well and I of course did not stick with that either. Maybe if I didn‚Äôt have ADHD I could have reached for the stars (not saying I can‚Äôt now but it‚Äôs much harder as a grown adult). Does anyone else ever feel this way? Or just feel like sometimes your fixations can be your mortal enemy?

Observations:

30mg, 8:00am

Onset noticeable at 10:00

A little less distracted by useless/inconvenient thoughts.

Spatial awareness is better, losing things less.

Slight impulsivity reduction.

Apetite slightly affected. Trying to Eat and hydrating well.

Ticks minimally affected on 1 day so far, not an issue for me.

Task initiation slightly improved but enthusiasm seems blunted.

Feeling sleepy/tired with some wakefulness at the same time, feels paradoxical when experiencing two opposing states.
(Between 13:00 - 14:00).

Feels like it wears off Completely and rapidly by 15:00
(Dosage adjustments? Adaptation period?)

Really hard to continue work tasks beyond this point in time.

I found out when I had a completely disproportionate emotional reaction to something that happened in my life. I described what I felt, and how I felt it, and my physical reactions to two close friends. Both said it was an abnormal reaction or overreaction. One said I should research it in terms of ADHD. That‚Äôs how I found out about it.

Until this week, I thought I just felt things deeply. That I was emotionally sensitive. But now that I am voraciously reading, everything I can, I am connecting the dots, and I‚Äôm learning about how my emotional reactions were often inappropriate or completely out of scale, at least throughout my adult life.

This is kind of heartbreaking for me, as I‚Äôve done so much in at work to maintain peace of mind, and really work on myself to be able to control my thoughts, my mind, my emotions, and my life. But it seems I have had some things slip. 

I‚Äôm speaking to my doctor about this again in three weeks time. 

My question is, kind of open ended‚Ä¶ Can medication really help with this? I won‚Äôt go on antidepressants again, is there something else that would help?

To be more specific as I was randomly spacing out while I was studying (coming back from lala land was a jump scare in itself üíÄ) I suddenly had this completely random thought that maybe I had ADHD. 

At first I tried to play it off, telling myself that I was overreacting and trying to self diagnose myself. But as I went into more research about what ADHD could present as, I realized that I could relate to most of the symptoms as I have been experiencing them for most of my life. 

My terrible memory for example has been one of the reasons why my family likes joke about how I'm an old lady. And just five minutes ago I think I might have experienced ADHD overstimulation. So as I've been trying to connect the dots and connect more of the symptoms to my everyday life, I decided to go see my doctor about it. But at the same time I've started to have more doubts. Because as I got more in depth of my research it's listed that everyone experiences them at some point. Which makes me anxious that I've been making a big deal over nothing. I'm afraid that if the doctor diagnoses that don't have ADHD I would have gone through this for nothing.

I've got a genuine question about my medications for anyone who is qualified (or has experienced the same thing I have).

I've been taking ADHD medications since I was in middle school (currently in university), and I've always struggled with the same problem. I am aware that these types of medications are stimulants and, as such, will enhance dopamine. However, whenever I take my medication, that euphoric feeling that people always describe only lasts about an hour for me before going away. I've taken both short and long-acting versions of my meds for years, but I've always hated taking them because even though, at the very least, my medication is supposed to last for 4 hours (assuming I take short-acting that day), the feeling of happiness goes away only about an hour in, and I'm left feeling pretty empty and easily irritable for the remainder of the time the medication is in my system. Is this normal? Have other people with ADHD experienced this? When I talked to my psychiatrist about this, I wasn't really given an answer that was helpful. 

I realize that this post may sound like I am trying to chase a feeling, But I swear that is not my intention. As I've said, I've spent most of my life taking ADHD medication, and although it feels good and helpful for the first hour, it genuinely feels draining and upsetting after that. For years, it has made me not want to take my medication, and the only reason I take it now is because that first hour lets me get sufficient studying done.

I'm a IT Freelancer currently in the process of quitting my job (at least temporarily). Since going to therapy I realized that I am more depressed then I thought i was. The anhedonic side of the depression is most challenging for me. 

I was diagnosed late in life so I already finished my bachelor and quit my masters degree and worked for a few years before receiving atomoxetine and therapy. I think I pushed myself through the wrong major as nothing around work sparks any joy, interests or anything positive, so I have to push my self extremely to manage to get any work done during the week, and require lot's of coping. 

This led to me nearly having a burnout and breaking down at therapy and at home. After talking to the therapist I decided to take a break for a while and figure somethings out. Which I struggle with. When I was asked to do 'something that is good for me and I enjoy' I really have trouble to come up with something. 

The only things which fit that category and I can also do right now are: Bouldering, cooking and walking. But i cannot do that for so many hours.  

It would be also great to find any pointers towards a career but that is not the main goal right now..

**Main part:** Basically since I was undiagnosed for a long time and only started to take atomoxetine  approx. 6 months ago I had to push through life and learned to discard all ""unnecessary"" things in life. 

Since work and study was so demanding I feel like I removed all parts besides that and now I don't really know what I enjoy or sparks my interests.

I‚Äôm 27 yo, recently diagnosed with ADHD (both inattentive and hyperactive) and I started taking medication at the end of September.

Now, the effect of the pills wears off after 5 hours max, so my idea is to ask if we can go up (he told me from the start that I can take max 60 mg a day so we‚Äôre safe on that front) but as soon as I drink coffee, even with a 20 mg dose which is pretty mild, I start feeling jittery, my heart seems to go out of my chest and I feel like when I have anxiety and I‚Äôm on the verge of a panic attack.

For those of the community in professional roles juggling a broad array of workstreams and project management duties, I‚Äôm reaching out to those who‚Äôve navigated the complex waters of adult ADHD in similar roles. 

I find myself repeatedly facing the challenge of overcomplicating tasks, grappling with perfectionism, maintaining organisational and processing discipline after meetings and notes are captured, and struggling to distill information into concise, potent summaries tailored to my audience - both upwards and downwards, and I can sense their patience shrinking, and I feel as though I'm on borrowed time which is wreaking havoc on my mental health.  

Each year, my annual review highlights these areas, and while I'm always making some progress here from work on personal growth, the demands on me are growing faster than I feel i am able to evolve my approach. I'm in search of tangible, actionable advice that can make a real difference in my approach.  

How have you learned to streamline your communication to ensure you're presenting information at the right level? What strategies or tools have you adopted to manage the tendency to overcomplicate, and how do you combat the perfectionist streak that can impede productivity?  

Any practical tips, systems, or methodologies that have helped you  focus on critical points and deliver clear, concise presentations would be incredibly valuable.

I'd be grateful for your experiences, no matter how big or small.

I have always been super impulsive, I have adhd and anxiety and speaking the first things that pops into my mind has been something I have always done. For the past 6 to 7 years tho, I have been trying not to, as it as led me to lose friends and acquaintaces. I either lose them because they think I lack empathy or something (just because I said something jokingly right off the bat impulsively, even if I love the person I'm refering to, or even if I mean it in the nicest way, people just assume the opposite), or because I say something that I was not supposed to say (like something that was kinda a secret, or not really a secret but I said it nervously in an hyperbolic way). My ""friends"" always said ""think before you speak no?"", and I always thought that was fucking stupid, because I don't think before I speak, so how the hell am I gonna do that? But since I'm really anxious and when people get mad at me I feel bad for days or weeks, I'm trying to do just that. But it's so hard, I go months thinking before I speak, and I get just more lonely and wanting to be on my own because I'm thinking and ovethinking before I talk which leads me to either take to long to reply and miss the window in a group of people, or just makes me bored. But I try, and nowadays I always say ""yeah I shouldn't talk about that"", ""yeah I don't know but"", but then I get confortable with the people, or I get anxious or HAPPY of all things, and the defenses come crashing down for a split second, I'm having fun, I'm having the time of my life, I finally like being with people again, and BOOM, I say one stupid shit that hurts someone and I'm back to not talking and feeling like shit. Does anyone else have this problem?

I found that, as with many other things, like attract like, so even though ADHD isn't that common, now that I'm well informed and diagnosed finally in my 40s I keep seeing it in so many people I consider closest. This includes my father and sister, my girlfriend and few of my closest friends. 

Most these people have a certain struggle in life (depressive symptoms or something internal they feel they need to overcome in order to live live fully), and since I started talking openly about my own experience and diagnosis, they have identified so much with it that they got very curious about it themselves and consider getting diagnosed. I try not to talk too much to people about my new diagnosis because of stigma and all. But sometimes I recognize it in other people and I feel like they can use the same kind of information I started with when I finally suspected having ADHD, which was not long ago. 

To put things in perspective, I live in a place where adult ADHD isn't even a thing - not diagnosed, treated or talked about. I had to investigate it myself, self diagnose and then finally confirm that in a country abroad with a psychologist and a psychiatrist to get treatment. Suffice to say my life already changed so much. Finally! 

In your experience, for those diagnosed late - what was your experience in regards to this, recognizing the disorder so often in your own vicinity, and has the 'adhd attraction' proven real?

Not only my psych (new one not the one that diagnosed me) and psicologist doubt my ADHD diagnosis (especially my psych, for reasons like having good grades, me being an adult and adhd beign diagnosed on children, Elvanse aka Vyvanse not having an effect on me, being able to focus on things I enjoy while true ADHDers have trouble focusing on everything ), now I'm doubting having ADHD and feeling again conflicted about who I am, why do I feel like I do, where do these not so positive  traits come from.

I was diagnosed with adult ADHD around a couple of years ago and received multiple treatments and medications for it. Ritalin did help me for a while at first but the effects surely declined and I quit it eventually because it just made me more anxious.

A helpful tip that I've always gotten is to follow a routine and or define the tasks I'm willing to achieve throughout the day sorted by the order of their importance. Now, I've tried various apps, techniques and mechanisms but still am unable to develop that sense of self accountability and end up not following it or procrastinating. 

There's so much lack of motivation now that I just feel chronically fatigued and exhausted and it feels like no amount of rest I get is going to get me out of it. Overstimulation and instant gratification is also something that I think may be contributing in this entire lack of drive and interest towards anything.

I don't think so. The example given on the [ed.gov](https://ed.gov) website of doing this is completely changing a test for a student with a disability.

Also....the biggest accommodation is extended test times....if said person with disability knows when the test is and how long it is they should be able to conform to the testing time....right?

I just don't have the creativity or focus to write out an email or document of a timeline on something that happened at work... that the CEO has to kind of take charge for me.

I'm the one that solves everything and helped us retain many clients, so a part of me knows I'm not seen as a disappointment, but I feel it.

This past year I noticed that it has been way more difficult for me to pay attention. I have also been a lot more forgetful than usual, and even have to really try to pay attention at conferences and during meetings as well.

 This has been very difficult for me because so much of my job involves reading the literature, speaking with stakeholders, developing methods, and conducting research. This has also been difficult because it somewhat also feels like a ""loss of self"" since beforehand, I was quite good when it comes to these things. In addition, I noticed that I have become slightly more ""tongue twisted"" when trying to explains stuff and have experienced brain fog more often. I should also note that I have anxiety, and have been diagnosed with anxiety for more than a decade. 

It is very strange for these symptoms to occur again but here I am. I feel so confused on what to do next or even what doctor to see. I am also unsure if others have experienced this as well...specifically in their adulthood. 

With that being said, has anyone experienced ADHD related symptoms in their 30s after not having done so since they were a kid? How did you recognize what you were going through and how did you move forward?

30F! Diagnosed with ADHD like 2-3 years ago. So, I'm already on 450mg of wellbutrin. it's a lot, but it's been the best dosage for me. I can hold onto thoughts way better! It doesn't help with a lot of my other symptoms though, like executive dysfunction and general motivation. Sending a single e-mail freezes me up. It's a lot of that ""i'm so behind aaaaaaaaa"" and then my brain freezes.

I finally saw a new psych last week, who feels a lot of these symptoms are related to anxiety, so she prescribed me prozac. 10mg for the first week, 20mg for the remaining 3 or so weeks until our next appt.

I have taken prozac before, but for PMDD where they only had me take it for like 10 days or something. It worked for PMDD but once I was off it, I felt worse. :) Psych wants to see how I do if I add it to my daily meds.

It's only Week 1, and gdi, I feel numb af. The only thing I can feel like I want to do is cross stitch and that's just because it's so...monotonous? I'm following a pattern. It makes a thing. I was fixated on gaming last week and now I don't even find joy in that. Feels like a chore, and yo, it's Stardew Valley. A game I have 250 hours in, and doesn't require that much thinking.

A lot of my research indicates a lot of people like this combo, but I'm having a hard time finding how long it took to like this combo for ADHD specifically. Work right now is also extremely busy! It's a perfect storm. Is it the meds? Is it work?? Who knows! But work doesn't clear up until January 1st.

It‚Äôs been a few years since I‚Äôve vomited from anxiety (usually triggered when I have to eat food which makes me aware of my stomach and how it feels). My alcoholic mother would always be sick before an event and so I learned that big events = vomiting and anxiety. I‚Äôve had hypno to deal with it, but its back.

I had my hen do a few weeks ago and was having a ball until I suddenly found myself overstimulated - a bit drunk, not loving being the centre of attention - and anxious. During dinner (teamed with karaoke which I usually love) I kept having to run to the bathroom and be sick. The shame and guilt I felt for having this come up during such a beautiful moment was too much to bear. The rest of the weekend was great once I‚Äôd done some tapping/left that night early, but I was worried about the wedding (and really upset that anxiety was back in town).

Cut to the wedding and I‚Äôm having a great time. It‚Äôs beautiful. We get to dinner and I eat a little bread and the speeches start/our mains are placed down. Suddenly I am OVERCOME with nausea and for the next three hours cannot think about anything else. Even post dinner during dancing I ended up being sick multiple times and needing to take 20 mins in the toilet alone, eyes shut. Masked to the eyeballs so nobody realised. Once the reception was over (and we went to more karaoke) I was fine, but the shame and guilt over those few hours is ringing clearly. I nearly ruined my own wedding. 

What the fuck is going on? Is it a fear of being unable to escape? Overstimulation? Food? Is this ADHD related or does it sound like an autistic response? My mind is going crazy.

My doctor prescribed concerta, which had some weird side effects at first but worked wonderfully. I felt less anxious, slept better, and I could finally focus properly on my classes.

Due to the medication shortage that's being going on all around the world, I couldn't get my medication for about a month, and when I went to the doctor again he prescribed me Ritalin because it's more likely to be in stock. 

For the first month everything was normal. When I ran out of meds and went to a pharmacy to restock (not my usual one) they gave me Rubifen and said it was the generic form of Ritalin.

And I've been really struggling on Rubifen. I have to take it at around 8 AM because of my class schedule and I have classes till 6 PM most days. It gives me heart palpitations when I walk at a brisk pace or have to go up stairs. And it messes with my appetite a lot. I always wake up starving, like with actual hunger pangs, which has never happened to me before. I also feel that its positive effects barely last till lunch time.

Does anyone have tips for taking Rubifen successfully while managing the side effects?

I have predominantly inattentive ADHD, while my husband has undiagnosed (but pretty obvious) predominantly hyperactive ADHD (he's the reason I discovered my own ADHD and got diagnosed, although he still remains undiagnosed).

Anyway, I've always struggled with weight management due to intense spells of apathy caused by brain fog.  I can stay at home and keep myself entertained in the bed or on the sofa for days through daydreaming, watching TV, playing games on my phone or laptop, procrastinating everything, including the physical things like walking which I actually like.

My husband who's been skinny up until his early twenties (when he hit the gym and put on some bulk) says he cannot keep still. I think he takes ""normal"" amounts of downtime (I suppose comparable to people who don't have ADHD), but otherwise cannot do the whole recluse-type behavior I'd engage in before starting meds.

He remains fit and manages his weight rather well and is generally good at self-care (at least physically;  he struggles to advance in terms of academics) while I spiraled down (yet again - for the umpth time in my life) into binge eating and weight gain (which I'm slowly getting out of with the help of lisdexamphetamine).

I want to check if I'm experiencing confirmation bias, but it seems to me those who have predominantly hyperactive ADHD are able to manage their weight more easily and/or don't struggle with it much, while us with the inattentive type might have a harder time (which possibly includes people with the combined type - I think one of my husband's friends has a combined type, and has struggled with some weight gain during Covid but also bounced back seemingly easily within a span of a few months).

I brought it up with my parents and they agree with me. They also think he has it. He fits all the criteria. Nonetheless, they don't want to discuss the matter with him, since they think it would ""upset"" him, making him lose his self-esteem and confidence.

They believe he's doing fine enough and doesn't need any help since he managed to graduate university and has now started a master's degree. 

In my opinion he's only ""functioning"" because he's living at home so he isn't doing any chores. Moreover he never studies or pays attention in class but just revises a couple of minutes before the exams and always manages to pass because he's smart. So he's doing ""good"" just because he is lucky.

Even if they think everything is fine, he has never been reliable, is always late for uni and periodically forgets about important obligations and bills etc. He has also injured himself many times because his hyperactive, impulsive self was doing dumb stuff. I think that not only he will crumble once he starts to live alone, but the current situation is draining for the whole household since we have additional labour because of him.

Having adhd as well, I dont ""blame"" him of course but I just wish he would get help, and I don't want him to struggle later on in the future. At the same time I'm torn because I study abroad so it's not ""my business"" anymore and maybe I shouldn't act like a parent.

It helped, because I got very calm but... I didn't like me at all! I missed the impulses and felt so boring to myself.

I can't put my phone down or stop occupying myself with anything and everything, even if on every level I want** to sleep already. My mind is constantly stuck on the thought that \*I can't end the day without something good at the end\*. A good meme, thoughtful post, interesting fanfic, funny message on a forum, literally anything - of course, \*nothing\* I try at that point is satisfying so I'm stuck in an endless loop of searching, until I finally break out. I'm aware that I'm doing this but it's like my brain forces me to continue, and I'm not even in control, because if one thing wasn't satisfying then we must try another, right?

This isn't a subtle thing. I have long ago accepted that I'm a night person, my activity only starts past 8pm. But getting to sleep at 4am or worse with knowledge that I wanted to sleep, my body wanted to sleep, and yet somehow I didn't is absolutely ruining me.  
I have not been officially diagnosed with adhd/add, however, I think this problem is likely caused by the fact that I'm really seeking dopamine (I really struggle with starting ANY task if it doesn't promise me satisfaction), which is why I think some of you may have met with something similar before.

P. S. I've seen a few old posts with a similar issue, so I'm sorry if this is a repetitive topic, but none of the responses really were helpful for me (e.g. white noise, or moving in with a partner, as I'm painfully single, exerise before bed isn't an option either for space & safety reasons), so I'll take my chance with this one.

2459,17vhc7r,t3_17vhc7r,FizzSerpent,Anger and criticism in relationships,"Hi all, 

This is a great community... It's so helpful and I've just discovered it! 

I don't have adhd (that I know of) and my partner thinks she does with 4 of her siblings having diagnosis.  I don't know if she has a diagnosis but briefly tried some medication earlier this year. 

I'm wondering if there's any chance what seems to me to be extreme anger could be related? 

I'll mention the smallest thing and will get reactions of extreme justification of herself, character attacks on me, attacking me if I've ever done something similar, attacking me for unrelated things... Justifying attacking me because she is hurt so it's OK to hurt me.. 

I told her last night I have a hard time sharing cause I'm scared and got the whole 9 yards. 

The only way out is to put aside anything and everything I said or feel, capitulate, show her love, and even then it can take days for her to calm down. 

We've occasionally had an ok talk about it where she says she feels so criticised and bad about herself  that the only safe feeling for her is to bring up a wall of anger and to justify her hate so she can feel better about herself again. 

Does this resonate with anyone?  Any tips or understanding that can come my way?   I don't really know what to do about it and have no idea if this is related to adhd, or anger problems, or maybe I'm just overly critical.

Do some of you feel like maybe in reality we are much more detail oriented than other people, and we can give details that really are necessary to help in certain situations?  
For example I used to write a lot of reports at my old work, when things went ""wrong"".

At first I was ""offended"" by that idea, (ill explain why in a moment) but then the more I began to think about it, the more I found it to be true. 

For the longest time, I constantly have this feeling of wanting to be ""away"" from other people, loved ones, crowds, strangers, etc. Yet, at the same time I enjoy good company, I like talking to people or at least knowing that someone is around. (It's odd, hypocritical).

I suffer from depression (and have for a long time), and I believe this is the reason the ""other half"" of me ""enjoys"" or at least wants to be in the company of others. 

It's so bizarre, My ADHD side wants to get away, needs space and yet my depressed side needs company. 

It's such a weird balancing act that it can get frustrating and tiring !

I have consulted multiple doctors, all of which have said that I likely have ADHD. However, due to the UK being odd, I can't get tested by myself until I'm 18 or over (currently 17). 

The only other option is to get tested through my college, which have quite literally ignored all of my requests to have this consulted.

So, while i wait to turn 18 to do it myself, I was wondering if y'all could answer some of my burning questions to help me figure out what the heck is wrong with me, as that would be a great help.

1) why am I filled with rage beyond words whenever I hear someone whistle, chew crisps, bite cutlery, breathe quickly/sperradically and many more. It is beginning to ruin my relationships with family and friends. I don't hate the people that do these, but when it happens I want to punch them lol
2) does ADHD just spawn in? I haven't struggled with symptoms this bad, except for the last 2 years. Was it dorment and then just activated or something?
3) is it even worth getting tested for ADHD? What would actually come of it?

I'll bend over backwards for random internet strangers and overshare like crazy. People will often get the impression that I'm flirting or romantically interested in them even though I'm not. It's a daily occurrence for me to wish I hadn't said something.

It also blows my mind when someone spots ill intentions from a mile away whereas I see nothing but the best in people. I assume everyone wants the same thing(s) I do and act accordingly. This may not have anything at all to do with ADHD, but I wanted to mention it anyway in case someone relates.

Yet another frustrating moment of this nature happened to me today, so I did a few google searches trying to get to the bottom of this.

And then I found my answer in the form of an epiphany unrelated to anything I was reading at the time.

***I do this stuff because I'm*** ***~~scared~~*** ***absolutely petrified of rejection***.

I knew about rejection sensitivity being a thing for ADHDers, but I *didn't* know that it leads to so much people pleasing on my part. The very idea of *anyone*‚Äîa complete and total stranger or my closest friends‚Äîhaving less than a sparkingly perfect opinion of me is enough to make my skin crawl. To avoid such a terrible fate, I subconsciously do anything that might make someone else happy even if it isn't what I truly want to do. Impulse control issues ftw (/s).

**Wanted: ADHD Helper**

* I'm looking for someone to come to my house once or twice per week, for 2 hours each day.
* I'll share the top things I want to accomplish, then you verbally check in with me every half hour to make sure I'm staying on track.
* At the end of the visit, I‚Äôll share what I‚Äôll keep doing on my own and what I may need to prepare before we meet again. (You would just have to listen, it's just me thinking out loud.)
* You don't have to be a disciplinarian, but you shouldn't be chatty or a pushover either.
* Payment is $25 per visit. While you're here, you'd have access to free water, free WIFI, and a quiet space to read, study, or do things online. (Please bring your own computer and earbuds.)
* If it matters, we have two friendly golden retrievers and a cat (who you'll rarely see).

I've been taking Adderall since college, most recently 30 mg XR  every day (usually Monday-Saturday). I've noticed that even on my medication, I tend to hyper fixate on things that are not related to work. This really sucks, and I've even been having panic attacks due to stress related to not getting as much work done as I want to with my vanishing attention. I don't understand why, but I just feel like I'm going up against this mental wall when I try to get back on task. Even tasks I know are easy become intimidating because I stress out so much about deadlines that I know I'm not going to make.

In addition to this, I've been off my meds for about a week because my doctor hasn't renewed my script yet. But honestly at this point I don't even know if it is worth going back on them. I just have no idea if they were ever actually helping. I definitely feel less productive at the moment, but it is probably just the shitiness of going off the medication.

On one hand, I feel like the meds may have been helping in part, and I need to go back on it, but on the other I am sick of being dependent on this medication that has a spotty track record for me at best, and causes huge issues for me when I fuck up and forget to call and re-up my prescription.

Please share your experience of what you would have wish other people knew about you, that could have helped the other party (assuming someone who have not interacted with someone with these diagnosis before) in having wholesome time together.


To be frank, I ask this because there are often times where I ask a question about e.g. dogs (because she loves dogs), and then I get confused as the conversation changed to talking about the best roast beef recepie all of sudden, and then I am sitting there listening to my MIL complain about why the prices of butter is so expensive. I am bewildered.  I am also constantly interrupted.  


I give her the satisfaction of her believing  she just had the best conversation in the world. Example: She asked me how my day was. I only just said 5 words: ""Well, I took the train..."" - and she cut me off.  I then proceeded to let her talk about her most favourite train ride that she took when she was 10 years old, then said she misses her mom, then asks how my mom is doing, but I didn't get to answer, then she said let's plan for your mom's birthday party...""etc.  Then she says: ""Well, that was great catching up! That was one of the best conversation we had!"".  Did she say this because this was the first time I didn't correct her by saying ""Hold on, you asked me a question, let me answer it""?  


Do provide insight on how to navigate this as I don't want to hurt her feelings. She is easily hurt and defensive.  I just want to spend time with her while I feel valued as well.

It's been fine but I'm hitting my final straw with their patient support and need quick advice.  
Essentially, after getting a script of Vyvanse sent in to a pharmacy closer to me a few days ago, I learned they were out of the generic version and my insurance has stopped covering the name brand, so if I wanted to pick up Vyvanse, I'd have to pay $350. I tried going through circle medical's new chat feature, but knowing how slow they can be, I booked a same day appointment with my PCP to get the prescription sent to my previous pharmacy (the one thing my insurance is actually good for). Come to find out, my doctor submitted a script for a chewable version of the meds (who knew that existed) instead of the capsules and that pharmacy was also entirely out of every version of the medicine, neither of these pharmacies knowing when they'll get a new order in because the entire county's stock of generic vyvanse is on backorder it seems.

I wound up finding a pharmacy about 45 minutes away from me where my girlfriends family lives that has it in stock, but my PCP doesn't have any appointments today and as always, Circle Medical's chat is so slow I don't know when I'll hear from them.

So with all that said, if I were to book an appointment with a doctor that isn't my PCP today through Circle, would they be able to correct my PCP's mistakes and send a script to the new pharmacy?

Then I went to see an ADHD specialist, and she said that she offers evaluations at $3,500, no option for insurance, but can be paid in installments or in full.

I just recently got rediagnosed for adhd  and started on medication for first time in my life (originally diagnosed but never medicated as a kid)

I wanted  to mention my psychiatrist has been amazing, couldn‚Äôt ask for a more understanding person throughout this process !

I was first started on generic concerta 18mg XR witch unfortunately didn‚Äôt work out

 Concerta was giving me some slight irritability issues, a raised heart rate, and it was inconsistent day to day, but it did give me good focus

So my psychiatrist swapped me to adderall (generic capsule), and so far everything has been wonderful no side effects at all

I was first started on 10mg XR, and went up to 15mg XR a month later and received better benefits from the medication with no side effects still (was hopping for better focus similar to the concerta though) 


When I mentioned the focus issue to my psychiatrist she upped me 20mg XR again no negative side effect but-

My main issue is that after going from 15mg to 20mg is that I still see slight benefits but not nearly as many benefits as I did when I initially went from 10mg to 15mg

 I was still kinda hoping for a bit more focus like the concerta gave me but im not sure if going up another 5mg (25mg) is worth it either considering going from 15mg to 20mg I only saw a slight change in positive benefits ?

I‚Äôve also looked at other post on this subreddit about finding the right dose, and when to stop upping the dose but it still feels confusing/unclear 


My psychiatrist had also mentioned that I could add a ‚Äúir booster‚Äù for the afternoon sense  I had mentioned feeling more focused in the morning after taking my meds then I did  in the afternoon but I wasn‚Äôt sure about it (might mentioned it at my next appointment)

Almost my entire family, cousins, second cousins, aunts uncles grandparents etc are all diagnosed. It‚Äôs like a psychiatrists wet dream to read my family history. Ive been on Vyvanse as long as I can remember, but when I became preg and the shortage hit, I had to switch to adderall. I lost my insurance after pregnancy and moving states so I couldn‚Äôt afford brand name Vyvanse anymore, so I stuck with adderall patiently until generic Vyvanse was released. Now I do understand my hormones are different post partum, I haven‚Äôt been on Vyvanse in 14 months, but Christ on a cracker about an hour after I took my first generic dose I was bare toe GRIPPING my bathroom floor praying to every single deity known to man to make the shits stop. I was screaming crying throwing up asking my husband if I somehow took laxatives instead of my meds, which he assured me I did not. It felt like I was back in highschool watching my friends sketchy older brother cut his drugs he was selling with laxatives and baby powder. 

After that bathroom battle stopped, it‚Äôs like I took nothing. I was staring at my pill bottle and counting them feeling like I was being gaslit by my pharmacist. I know Vyvanse is less potent than adderall but my god I could‚Äôve stared at the wall all day from how disconnected my brain felt from my body. Has anyone else gone through this?

I take Methylphenidate ER and while it works pretty well in controlling my ADHD symptoms, I feel the crash by the time I'm done work making it harder for me to fully enjoy precious family time in the evenings.

I talked to my doctor about it and I suggested having a small dosage IR boost in the afternoon but they didnt like the idea of me taking two versions (IR and ER) of the medication.

So  I was thinking about asking to switch completely to IR next time I meed my doc. But I would like to hear about your experiences so I can assess from different perspectives..

In particular, I was wondering if people who take IR do in fact experience more flexibility in terms of ""crash control""? Also, is ""efficiency"" and ""potency"" any different between IR and ER?

No problem, I thought. I had heard there was a supply shortage, and since I don't take it on weekends I had extra, so I figured I would just wait a week or two and check back with my regular pharmacy on whether it was in stock again.

Two weeks later I walked up to the counter and asked if they had it back in stock. The new employee wasn't sure, so she went into the back to check and then informed me that they have it, so I asked her to fill my prescription and said I would come back later when it was ready.

An hour later I got a phone call from her superior, who said the new employee had made a mistake in telling me that it could be filled. She informed me the problem wasn't ever the supply, but that my insurance was no longer covering enough of an amount that makes financial sense to them, so that they just wouldn't fill it for me because the pharmacy would be losing money?

Can someone explain this to me? I was confused on what she meant, but English was not her first language, and I couldn't get a straight answer. She said without insurance it would cost a few hundred dollars for both the name brand and the generic. I assume this all has something to do with the generic being available now and Vyvanse ending it's coupon program, but I am unsure of how it all fits together and where to go from here.

What I am seeking is a description of how your particular medication feels after an extended period (months+) of regular use. I think this would be very helpful to newbies looking to understand how their changing experience fits into the arc of effects felt from the first day to the intended long-term effects.

I am most interested in the short-term (<24 hrs) effects/sensation/feeling/changes you experience when taking your medication. Reason being, it is early days and more subtle effects are super hard to discern.

Any additional information/context would be much appreciated, as more info is always good and I understand not everyone experiences immediate effects day-to-day but still benefit.

One final note:

I understand the concept of ""chasing the dragon"" and ""the honeymoon phase."" Both important concepts to be aware of, but my goal here is not a dragon or a honeymoon.

I can read a lot and understand fully and can stand up for myself. I think the irritability when you are on strattera is partly due to realizing and having the capacity to pay attention to what used to seem normal but secretly made you feel angry. Understanding the anger while on strattera made me let it go as now i can take actions and direct my anger into something productive, anger is an extremely useful emotion, it sparks fires in you to change your life and if you are able to hold on to these fires even if they are painful you can start to fix, and let go.

It just takes me a long time to go from getting an assignment to producing my deliverables.

I can do stuff that I usually don't like to, and when I do, I do it better (i.e. cleaning), which gives me good dopamine, and I'm using TikTok a lot less (I chose to clean the vacuum cleaner and some furniture instead of using TikTok), I eat much slower (I usually eat so fast people always tell me that I seem afraid that someone is going to take it from me, which makes me seem uneducated) and listen to music a lot less (I love music, but I know that I abuse it), maybe because A. I don't need that extra stimulus, and B: I don't need the music to cover all my thoughts lol. I still have runinng music in my head sometimes, but at a very lower volume.

I don't know if I'm getting addicted to it, but I go to bed happy that the day after I can take my medication and feel better. 

I feel a bit more irritable, but can handle it better maybe. Lastly, when I crash, symptoms come back and a bit worse tbh, I know that taking a booster dose will help delay the crash though, and I'm still taking small doses.

How am I supposed to manage this when all my (supposed) faults, ""difficult"" character traits and being too much for other people, my inner experience has simply been completely internalized by these negative experiences and my view of myself has become almost 100% negative as a result?

Unlike others, I would say I don‚Äôt necessarily fit into the stereotype of how someone would view a person with ADHD. 

I‚Äôm 16, female, and am definitely on the more self-aware side. I‚Äôve never cared much for school, but I‚Äôd always pass with an A, sometimes a B. Have never studied a day in my life, and I‚Äôd be content with either of those 2, as long as it wasn‚Äôt a C or below. I‚Äôm not attempting to brag, just stating what I am like. 
My brother is extremely smart, and would assist me with Math occasionally. He‚Äôs commented on how he thinks I might have ADHD- and this is where my thoughts on it also stemmed from. 

To get into detail a little more:
I have trouble paying attention to things I‚Äôm not particularly interested in, but if it were important, I would. I‚Äôm fully capable of forcing myself to sit through something unbearable, which is slightly contradictory. 

I constantly need to fidget with items, I physically cannot sit still most of the time. But AGAIN, I have the ability to force myself to not do anything. 

I lack the most basic comprehension. Despite my intelligence in academics, I have an extremely difficult time processing speech or readings. I frequently ask my brother for assistance on these matters. No matter how hard I try, or reread the sentence, I find myself stumped. 

And this brings me to why I constantly doubt myself. I am physically capable of forcing myself and body to remain still and listen, so is all this even an indication I might have ADHD?

I'm really big into coffee, and I had been using caffeine to sort of self-medicate for years now (without even realising it). It was never as effective as I believe Concerta is - but I find it hard not having a cup every now and then.

I just wanted to be careful seeing as caffeine is also a stimulant. On my college campus, I opted for a decaf version of a Caramel Frappucino at Starbucks. I'd taken the pill a good few hours before.

It has however nearly completely gotten rid of my everyday anxiety. I have an anxiety disorder and I do still get anxious but not nearly as often, about as many things, or as intensely as I did pre-strattera.

  
I am going to need to find a new medication because I need to find something that will allow me to sit and be productive but I am nervous to not find something that has done what Strattera did for my anxiety.

  
Any recommendations for other ADHD meds that have some anxiety overlap?

I have tried adderall and vyvanse to help me study before starting Strattera. They made me feel normal and definitely more productive adderall moreso. My dilemma is that I was already anxious during the time period I took them so I don't have a good measure on if they made my anxiety better, worse, or had no effect. I definitely did get very anxious at times, but I was very anxious a lot of the time before I was medicated.

  
Other notable side effects I experienced on Strattera:

* When taken anytime before noon I would experience very intense periods of fatigue around 2-4. It was very very difficult to stay awake. I tried to combat this at first by taking it instead at night. This however led to me not being able to sleep and being restless the entire night.

He just suggested Instead of meds, that I just go for walks and drink a coffee.

6 months later, my life is kind of fucked, Im sleeping at 2-3am, drinking several energy drinks on top of coffee, I am constantly stressed, and work takes me twice as long. None of these are good for my quote on quote heart. So I sent a message to my doctor, asking for an alternative, or to get back on my meds even if it means going through a psychiatrist. This man then proceeds to send me a rude message essentially saying under no circumstances will he represcribe my medication and that he is not a psychiatrist. In the back of my mind all Im thinking is, if this man is qualified to prescribe me these meds, why is he qualified enough to unprescribe them??? Like I was doing fine before, and all of a sudden he changed them. Anyways I have an appointment with him tomorrow, will hopefully get a referral to a psychiatrist or an alternative treatment. If he is rude I think I will switch docs as well.

-I asked for a stimulant if Stattera doesn't work. She made it sound like a big deal. ""You'll have to come in the office, get an EKG, insurance says, etc"" Im fine with all that, but damn.
-I had to do labs and filled out a release of information whatever so she could get the diagnosis from my previous therapist.

2660,17umxpu,t3_17umxpu,Gnosis-87,Need some advice or help,"Hello all,

Recently (two years ago) I was diagnosed. I always thought I had it, but as a child my mother thought it was fake so I never got help. After seeing someone for anxiety, I was told it‚Äôs due to untreated adult ADHD. I‚Äôve been seeking help for it, and making progress understanding. 

At this moment the advice I‚Äôm seeking has to do with the struggle of finding meaning. This effects a lot of different things in my life, mainly a career. As I‚Äôve learned, ADHD makes it hard to focus on things you don‚Äôt necessarily like, and hyper focus on things you find interesting. I‚Äôve noticed that it‚Äôs been harder and harder to find those things I‚Äôm usually interested in interesting. Instead, I‚Äôve been using my free time indulging in video game addiction, almost unwillingly.

I would rather use my free time to find a better career. It feels impossible to put the phone down and focus on what I need to do to build a better path. Always been in restaurants, but I‚Äôm getting to old, and I have a young family I‚Äôm trying to provide for. Things I‚Äôve come to the conclusion of is:
I can‚Äôt stand working for other people anymore.
I can‚Äôt stand not using my mind/creativity.

Every time I get a chance to think about what to do, I almost automatically jump into lazy mode and start playing games. I feel like I should be using my time more productively, building multiple forms of income and building my own thing. Not being able to is literally leading me down a depressive path where I just don‚Äôt see myself doing anything. It‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs two people in me. One who wants to more, and one that knows I can‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm not sure if ADHD is a genetic disorder so I‚Äôm not sure if having someone in your family who has it makes it more likely. 

But I also have some symptoms that might relate to it or not at all. At times I do forget things, for example I have a plant in my room that I found out existed and forgot to water. A lot of my clothes in my room are thrown everywhere or I simply forget to put them away or in the laundry basket. I do at times struggle paying attention and wander off in my head thinking about random things, daydreaming, focusing on other things around me, things like that. My own father has told me I am easily distracted. I have been called ‚Äúlazy‚Äù all my life although there are things I can easily focus on at times. Although there are things I would love to do but just lack motivation at times. My friends scream at me but it takes time to catch my attention when we play games. Even doing homework that interests me, I lack motivation in. Many of my family members say I talk a lot or too much and never get to the point of things I talk about.

There is big list but I don‚Äôt want to go on. Another question is, is ADHD diagnosed earlier in years or can it develop later on or be ignored by teachers while in middle and high school? I‚Äôm currently 19 and in college and have only realized this now.

Again I mean no harm to anyone with ADHD I‚Äôm just very confused on this idea and want to know if I should get tested.

My already nonexistent motivation is destroyed by the thought I could sweat. Sweat literally pisses me off. I‚Äôm put in a bad mood and ofc no one wants to do shit in a bad mood. 

I‚Äôve become really sedentary and I need to fix it, it‚Äôs not healthy. I‚Äôm struggling to try though because it means sweating. 

How do y‚Äôall manage with sweat? I have a sweatband I wear on my wrist to help but it can only do so much. 

How do you fight through the discomfort? How do you motivate yourself to do something that causes so much discomfort and disgust? 

It makes my clothes stick to me, it makes me mad, it makes me feel shitty, it‚Äôs practically a living hell over something so small

And I know there‚Äôs medications that can help with excessive sweating but I‚Äôm too worried about the possible dehydration that it can cause",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17ug96b/how_do_you_manage_sensory_issues_due_to_sweat/,True,2023-11-13 17:49:01,False,12,False,False,7,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/17ug96b/how_do_you_manage_sensory_issues_due_to_sweat/

I‚Äôve always been a freak about organizing my bedroom and will occasionally go on frenzied cleaning sprees when my wife and kids seem to have been particularly messy or inattentive to things. It just makes my brain happy to have things in order. Some of my biggest pitfalls are time blindness/being late, easily flustered and angered when overwhelmed with requests or loud noises, having trouble task switching (with it really pissing me off), hyper focusing (I‚Äôll spend hours researching something I‚Äôm interested in), and having a really hard time starting something I don‚Äôt want to do. It‚Äôs kind of frustrating because my wife doesn‚Äôt seem to think I need Adderall because I‚Äôm fairly good at the menial crap like cleaning and obsessing over preparedness, and that I can prattle on about Buddhism or some neuro-, social-, or cognitive science subject I‚Äôve been obsessed with lately. She says it makes me tense, but she doesn‚Äôt realize that I lack the mental stamina to have descent will power and forbearance when life gets hectic and the kids are driving me bonkers lol

I was in a very depressed state and the gym was my comfort zone. I was benching 2x my bodyweight, 2,5x squat, and 3x deadlift.

That was last year. I realized the addiction to working out was not really helping me pursue any goals. All I did was work, and go workout, and it made me kind of depressed again.

So I went back to trying to fix my high-school diploma (I flunked 2 classes) and now I work part-time.Finally got medicated as well.Since they were high school classes, and since I've went from full-time to part-time. I thought this would give more time, and make it easier.

I've recently started titration for my ADHD (on my third week), at the moment I'm on prolonged release methylphenidate (specifically 3x18mg Delmosart taken once in the morning). I had a question if anyone is able to give an answer about drinking alcohol while on it. I am aware that it is not recommended to drink while on the medicine, mainly for blood pressure reasons as far as I know, but I have a birthday party coming up and would like to partake in drinking if possible.

Typically I take the pills at around 8am, and then they are supposed to last about 12 hours, so it should have worn off by 8-10pm. My question is: will it be safe to drink that evening once the medication has pretty much worn off, or would it be safer to just skip a dose that day? For what it's worth, my blood pressure hasn't seen much of an increase since starting the medication, so it's not like I'm already nearing hypertension while just on the Delmosart.

Idk if I‚Äôm just being weird or this is just specific to myself, but since I‚Äôve started meds, my handwriting has gotten so much better.

2722,17ubri0,t3_17ubri0,DS_Future,Medication for ADHD,"Hi folks! I just joined this subreddit cause my brother (9) has ADHD and I want to help him. 

The doctor did give a prescription for meds to help him stay focused, but my parents did not give him any yet cause they didn't want him to depend on medication. 

But for the past few months, things have been tough for him at school. He can't focus on anything, and when he does, it's something that has no benefit to him. He isn't aware of his surroundings either, and has trouble connecting with anyone because he's lost in his own world of thoughts. He has caused a lot of trouble with his classmates too and can't control his emotions. He has a fixation on math and architecture, but he can't concentrate on any other school subjects because all his attention goes to math. And he has got an obsession with games and it has become too concerning.  

My parents are really out of touch. Heck, my mum doesn't even know what ADHD is cause she didn't bother researching on it even after my brother got diagnosed. I want to help him as much as I can.

Maybe it is time he needs the help of medication. We've heard it's helpful, but would it be harmful once the dose is complete? Or does he need to continue taking meds for a long time? Would it be okay for such a young kid to be taking meds?

He was a mediocre student, he was a successful procrastinator.  He had As, Bs and Cs, and all of his classes were stem related and college now courses. I just adore him. 

Since graduating back in June, he isn't handling life. He hasn't applied to any schools, hasn't  applied to jobs, and his only ""out in society"" time is when he sees his friends,  maybe twice a week. He cannot for the life of him regulate his sleeping schedule. He cannot force himself to exercise regularly. He spends the majority of his time hanging out with me, or gaming. He makes plans, then gets anxious about them, and it like, paralyzes him into doing nothing, and flaking on his own plans. Fixing his sleep, exercising, job hunting, applying for school....these are all things HE wants to do. He wants to adult. He just can't. I'd be thrilled with him getting a part time job. Rome wasn't built in a day. 

All of the adults around him give him advice and he gets overwhelmed trying to figure out who has the best advice. 

How do I help him?!? 
Parenting is hard at any age, and I am trying to transition from parenting to supporting, because he has to make his own decisions. 

I will never kick him out. Ever. He's my kid, adult or not. As long as I'm alive he'll have a home with me. But he still needs to adult

I have always used gaming as my fallback activity when I don't have the mental energy to be productive. I've never been much of a TV series/movie person because it's just not engaging or stimulating enough for a focused activity, so I tend to default to gaming in my downtime. 

Lately I've had this issue where I don't quite get the dopamine hit I'm expecting from whatever game I've set out for myself to play, and I'll convince myself that some other game is going to provide more relief/stimulation/whatever and I'll shift to that one to see if I'm correct. 


What quickly ends up happening is every 2-3 days I'll start fresh on a new game, I'll play it occasionally over the following days until I'm at most a few hours into a save file until I inevitably hop to the next game. 

What I'm struggling with here firstly is; should this be bothering me as much as it does? Secondly, is this habit even worth addressing? I'm in the process of making gradual incremental changes to other habits of mine which seem much more beneficial or impactful than addressing how I play my games in my downtime, but for some reason this is one thing that bothers me more than the rest. 


I used to have no issues playing games through until completion even if it took me weeks, so I really don't know what's changed.

I don't know if this is a common thing or not. Since I've been diagnosed, I've had two friends make comments about ADHD meds and how they impact people with ADHD differently to those without ADHD.

I have replied to say that meds affect everyone differently, and the way you react to medication is not a diagnostic tool. They are adamant about this - if you have ADHD then stimulant drugs will make you sleepy, and if they don't make you sleepy then you don't have ADHD. These two friends believe they have ADHD but have not been to the doctor about it, and they're saying this based on their personal experience with the recreational use of non-prescribed ADHD meds or other stimulant drugs.

I know that stimulant meds can be very relaxing for people with ADHD, your brain gets a chance to focus on one thing at a time, and its quieter in there. But I don't think a doctor has ever said to a patient - ""here take this and then tell me if it makes you sleepy or awake"", as a way to diagnose ADHD.

The implication from at least one of these friends in particular being that ""how can you have ADHD because dexies work on you?"" (dexies is a slang name for dexamphetamine where I live). Because I don't get exactly sleepy when I take my (properly prescribed and taken as directed) meds, so therefore how can I have ADHD.

No matter what I do I am so addicted to food. But the thing is, it‚Äôs not in a ‚Äútaste‚Äù way, or a cravings way, or a satiety way. the concept of food and flavor is so detached from it, it‚Äôs literally just about getting something in a shiny package, getting GUARANTEED dopamine from it and literally eating myself sick. Now knowing my diagnosis I just find it interesting. I will plan my whole day around the process of getting and eating food, and become disinterested after the initial bites. Most days, especially lately, I wish I could just get my calories and nutrients in one smoothie so I could get back all the brain space I devote to it. 

This is NOT an ED or unhealthy eating, I swear, and anyone I try to talk to about this will take it that way. This is why I have to restrict more than others, because ‚Äúintuitive eating‚Äù and ‚Äúeverything in moderation‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work when it‚Äôs a dopamine source. People always say, ‚Äúyou will end up binge eating if you restrict‚Äù no, I will end up binge eating if I DONT restrict.

Growing up I was really fat, like obese, and I was always getting talks about ‚Äúhealthy habits.‚Äù I was so confused about my eating habits/weight because I don‚Äôt even like food that much/wasn‚Äôt usually hungry.  I‚Äôll just find a single, usually brightly colored food item (nerd clusters, lol)  I like for a week and obsess over it and obsess about getting it and eating it, and if it‚Äôs not that one food it might as well be garbage. I was a food hoarder. And since I was young, I couldn‚Äôt do drugs or risky activities so fighting so hard for that dopamine that I literally was unable to get doing anything else lol.

My home life is too chaotic to focus on 2 hours of pre-class videos and quizzes. Then I go to class, and the instructor only wants to answer direct questions about the videos, without going over much (if any) of the rest of the material. But being that I only half-watched the video for the first time last night, I rarely even know what to ask. At the end of it, I really don't feel like I've learned a thing, and I certainly can't retain any of the information for exams.The whole format feels like it should work great, in theory.

I can't imagine any possible accommodation that would be better for me than just sitting in class with nothing to do but learn the material... which fundamentally isn't what some of these classes are offering.

I tried to find specific advice for solving the issues of this particular sitting position but couldn't find any specific enough. Description of the position:  


Sitting, right leg completely folded so that I am sitting on my foot with a lot of the right side of the shin laying against the chair. This causes a lot of tension in my knee and the muscles in my shin and above the knee, which leads to distracting pain once I'm trying to sleep. The left leg is also folded, but the foot is resting on the chair seat and the left knee is propped up against the left arm rest.

Being medicated has somewhat helped with executive dysfunction and I've gotten better but it's hit or miss and I'm always tired when I need to do things but struggle with sleep so it's tricky. 

However, I get overwhelmed with mess and clutter very easily. I think having a father who was a neat freak that yelled at me and my siblings for being messy and lazy triggered it. 

Clutter does not bother my partner of 4 years, and aside from a couple of tasks he will not do any house chores unless prompted. And if I get frustrated about him not doing it or taking too long to do it he just goes on like ""it's not even that clean"" or like I didn't really do much.

When starting, I told myself I would only take it on work days. Friday night I found myself laying in bed thinking about my workout the next day and debating if I should take it because I was able to lift more. An uncomfortable debate for such a reason. I made it a point not to take it. 

Today, I once again found myself constantly debating on taking it because I was getting angry easy with my kids again, hyperfocusing, losing track of time, depressed/brooding, the whole thing.

I would appreciate some advice. I'm currently a college student and while I am an adult, I still live with family, so there's the major obstacle.

I've brought up the idea that I might have adhd and was immediately shot down. Rather than listening to my reasoning, I was pretty much laughed at, or at least blown off. I wasn't a bad student, but every year, I would forget school work or something in my desk or in my backpack and my mom would scold me for that. When I brought that up as one example, she laughed at it. I get it's some silly memory of when I was a kid, but that's a major red flag for me. Now, deadlines are too much for me and they get away from me. I also changed my major like three times.

Anyway, I logged in to school, ready to retake a quiz for today and then realize that I have three things due. I knew they were due, but I told myself each time that I checked, that I would look at them after I do other important homework. Turns out, I needed to write an outline and film a speech. Turns out, they're not so bad, but at the time, my whole schedule was thrown off and I was overwhelmed.

I overheard my brother talking to himself about me to stop being lazy and focus. I can't stop thinking about that because I want to focus. I want to get work done early, but I just can't. They're not excuses. I don't feel listened to or understood. It's not just school, but everyday life too.

Something that I'm hooked up on is trying to figure out if I potentially have ADHD-PI or Long Covid. They both sound similar to me. The symptoms did start around COVID, but it was also when I started high school which is when the ADHD symptoms tend to get noticable. On top of that, I had also been in the hospital for chemotherapy throughout my first year of high school in 2019 so I don't really have a point of reference as to what ""normal"" HS is for me. I know I've had Covid before but I'm not entirely sure when the last time I had it was. I've been vaccinated and have gotten boosters, not the latest ones yet though. 

One of the main tells of ADHD vs Long Covid from what I've seen is how long the symptoms have been persisting. I honestly couldn't tell you if I had ADHD in my younger years, mostly because I can't really remember them that much. I had good grades and never had much academic trouble, but I wouldn't really consider myself a ""star student"" - it was just easy.

I struggle with managing ADHD symptoms as well as anxiety and depressive episodes. It's been hard for me to care for myself. I imagine I'm not the only one experiencing something like this right now either. So if you are - for whatever reason  - just know that all you can do is good enough for the time being. and that even when you don't feel like it you are worthy of taking care of yourself the best you can.

if eating is hard (like it is for me right now), it's okay to drink meal replacements if that's all you can do.

if brushing your teeth is hard, mouth wash when you feel able to is better than nothing.

if you have to sleep with the light on because the dark is lonely, keep it on.

needing to lay in your bed for long periods of time does not make you lazy. if getting up makes you exhausted then it's okay to rest.

needing more comfort items around you is not a sign of weakness. I've needed a heated blanket, something to chew on, and the same videos on repeat to feel safe and secure the past few weeks.

if it's hard to move your body, simply getting up to use the bathroom is okay to count as movement. I've found yoga to be relaxing, but I can only ever do the kind you can do on your bed, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIVDmRXzfVk&list=PLgKdNLSXOWVt0cTaMNVNrokZCsDakRke1&index=7&pp=gAQBiAQB) (video length: 17:57)

Mom took me off the medication in like 2nd grade tho and i never struggled in school academically most of my struggles were behavioral. 

Somehow between pre-k and 12th grade i forgot about my diagnosis so i just thought i was a bad lazy student for so long. Especially once i started college thats where all my problems really began, i was kinda carried through school because of covid i just cheated on my second half of high school.

I remembered again that i was diagnosed already and recently started connecting the dots on so many of my struggles.

My brother also has adhd and he was on medication because he struggled a lot more academically, i vividly remember when he had to read a book and we told him just read it. And he couldn‚Äôt and broke down crying. Then he finally got on medication and the next year he was at a highschool level of reading in 4th grade it was so sudden.

Now I was confused and sent the photos to my mom, but I still let her buy it. Now when my mom found out she lost it, saying I could have just told her to wait or said the price is wrong and the real price is 15. But at that moment I just didn't think of that, like it just wasn't it my head, now I think and it seemed like the simplest thing I could have done.

2835,17tr927,t3_17tr927,Darkshadoww11,Can ADHD be something that some people develop as a coping mechanism? And what is the relationship between ADHD and perfectionism?,"I recently did 2 sessions with a new therapist who gave me a completely different perspective on why I am the way I am. I'd have to write a 20-page essay to explain everything she said, but here is the main takeaway. I am a staunch perfectionist and this is something I developed from childhood. She said that basically it's a kind of ""program"" that my brain is running. I grew up thinking it's normal to harshly judge myself, never give myself any credit, always trying to do things to please and appease others, etc.   


I've been doing a lot of studying on what she told me, and I started to get ideas about what relation does this all have to the ADHD I have. I have a theory that ADHD could be something I also developed from childhood as a means to cope with this toxic perfectionism and my failures in life. Here are some examples.

&#x200B;

1. I lose focus on what I'm doing because my brain learned that it's easier to just do something else and ignore the consequences.
2. I don't pay attention to something someone is telling me to do because I make a subconscious conclusion in my mind that there's no point remembering this information because I won't finish this task to the standard this person wants me to anyway.
3. I procrastinate because the circumstances aren't ideal to even attempt to do this particular task.
4. I have lots of bouncing thoughts in my mind, many of which have to do with how others view me, think about me, expect from me, etc.

&#x200B;

These are just a few but notice how much intertwining there is between the symptoms of ADHD and perfectionism. I also started to think that it can be the other way around, basically this is like ""What came first, the chicken or the egg?"" question. I'm curious what others think, what's the right way to look at all this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17tr927/can_adhd_be_something_that_some_people_develop_as/,True,2023-11-12 19:13:14,False,2,False,False,1,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/17tr927/can_adhd_be_something_that_some_people_develop_as/

Locs: for Black wow man/men who desire hair, especially longer hair, locs are a great way to deal with low maintenance hair. You can start them yourself and pay someone to maintain them if money is an issue, or you can learn how to retwist them yourself.

 Loc maintenance can be as simple and as affordable as a moisturizing spray bottle and regular shampooing. 

Braids (especially knotless): if you have loose natural hair, maintaining it can be a bitch. That‚Äôs why styles like braids/twists can be convenient, especially knotless braid. They provide less tension on your natural hair, and since it starts with your natural hair being braided, it looks better and less unruly as it gets older. If money is an issue you can learn to do styles v√≠a YouTube. 

Doing pigtails or a braided ponytail is also a great low maintenance hairstyle for people of all races. 

You don‚Äôt have to worry about styling your hair regularly, just keep your braids clean and wrapped up in a bonnet or scarf if possible. 

Ulta/Hair Schools: this applies to everyone. If you want to get your hair regularly done, including trims, cuts, or straightened, this is an affordable and simple way to get these services. You don‚Äôt need to pay a deposit, cancellation services are flexible, and they‚Äôll work with you at the appointment to determine exactly what you need given the condition of your hair. 

Last but not least, if you‚Äôre like me and bonnets or scarfs can cause sensory issues or you forget to put them on, consider getting silk pillow cases to protect your hair.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17tqe2q/adhd_hair_hacks/,True,2023-11-12 18:32:55,False,2,False,False,5,0.86,/r/ADHD/comments/17tqe2q/adhd_hair_hacks/

This is my 2 cents, from my lived experience and some research which I'll share below. 

I'm making this post because day in and out I see reddit posts of people talking about their phone use. Worst of all, I see people blaming themselves. In reality, if you consider how **our brains are wired and how devices are designed today, I hope you'll join me in going easier on ourselves.** 

**First, lets talk brains.** 

As someone with ADHD you might experience: 

* difficulty controlling impulses 
* difficulty with emotional regulation 
* crave for new and exciting things 

These 3 points make people with ADHD more prone to digital addiction. Especially when phones are designed to be more addictive. 

Take social media for example. Companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok profit $$$ from getting you to stay there longer. 

**Apps today are designed with:** 

* Constant notifications which ding your brain's reward systems 
* Bottomless, new exciting content 
* Features like auto play and streaks to keep you there longer 

So it makes sense we're struggling! 

**The system isn't broken, it's designed this way. And our ADHD makes us extra vulnerable. But awareness brings power and most importantly, empathy for our ADHD selves.** ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17tqdjz/your_phone_and_adhd_an_argument_for_selfcompassion/,True,2023-11-12 18:32:11,False,35,False,False,122,0.97,/r/ADHD/comments/17tqdjz/your_phone_and_adhd_an_argument_for_selfcompassion/

How about a healing post about our positive interactions with our providers? It can be comforting to know that there *are* solid, educated, affirming professionals out there and they aren't all horrible to us.

I'll go first. I've been seeing my NP since 2019. She is trauma-informed, doesn't specialize in ADHD but has plenty of experience with folks like us, and she is the most open-minded, validating medical professional I've ever worked with (may be tied for 1st place with my current therapist). I truly find our appointments to be a safe place for me, and she has a very gentle way of challenging any maladaptive beliefs/thoughts I might express, while never making me feel judged or like I'm drug-seeking. She recognizes that my medication is important and helps me to function and I trust that she would do whatever she could to ensure my continued access to them.

I know I am incredibly fortunate to have found her and I wholeheartedly believe that her approach should be the *bare minimum* expected of a medical professional, but that's unfortunately not the case.

The problem is that I can't describe my symptoms properly and often forget things I wanted to tell. I was asked about my childhood and I panicked because I realised I don't remember almost anything and I don't know how I will provide enough informations for them to assess me adequately. I think about things to say and then when I come into the room I just forget all of them.

There is also the problem of not looking weird or different. I can't stop saying stuff that are not really what I think or that are not my real expeariences just to not look dumb or embarassing. I know psychologists are there to help me and not to judge but I can't stop and I don't even realize that I do it in the moment. And then I also feel embarassed to tell them that it is not true what I said I just said it because I didn't want to come off too strong/weird.

2859,17tng7h,t3_17tng7h,ArcheryOnThursday,Talk to me about medication tolerance...,"I've been on 10mg of Methylphenidate  2x a day. 
I think I'm developing a tolerance as it's just not as effective as it was when I started back in September. When I first started taking it, productivity was such an attractive force and I felt so calm. My emotional racing thoughts and rejection sensitivity felt completely under control.  I could feel my real feelings but I didnt have to be constantly vomiting my emotions everywhere and dragging other people into my stuff. Now, my emotions are starting to be harder to manage. I look at my to do list now, and it's kind of ""meh"" whereas before I was motivated and happy to get it all done. It felt rewarding to cross things off and finally feel like I have control of my life. But now it's not as nice a feeling. I feel like I'm back sliding in my progress, a bit. Some reasonably important things go undone everyday and I feel Meh about it. 

Does this mean I have developed a tolerance? What does one do in that situation? Do we take some time off it to break the tolerance? Do we ask for a dose increase or is this it? Is my dose a high one? What's the upper reasonable limit? I don't even know. I am newly diagnosed as of January/February of this year. 
Had a horrible experience with Wellbutrin and this is the next medication we tried. It was such a relief to have results at last. Disappointed that progress is falling off after just three months. 

If it's not tolerance, what else could it be? I have seen people talk about diet and what is best in conjunction with various medications. My label says take at least 30 minutes before a meal.  I'm pretty strict about that,  because I feel it is less effective when I dont stick to that timeline. Is there something else I should do to troubleshoot at my current dose?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17tng7h/talk_to_me_about_medication_tolerance/,True,2023-11-12 16:13:21,False,8,False,False,4,0.84,/r/ADHD/comments/17tng7h/talk_to_me_about_medication_tolerance/

I read some post that people dont have problems with taking meds daily and take a break on weekends. I have read that there are some new studies which show that taking ritalin over a long period, can cause the effect of feeling ""dumber"" when not increasing the dosis or stopping completely. I am not sure how to find the source again tbh since it has been some time last time I did my research. I wanted to take 20mg a day, maybe 4-5x a week.

2882,17tk0va,t3_17tk0va,slothyy46,ADHD and Going Overseas,"Hi everyone!


My doctor and I both highly suspect that I (22F) have a case of inattentive ADHD. My symptoms have become more and more prevalent since starting university, and during Covid lockdowns. I am on the list to see a specialist, but this appointment is not for many months yet.

Onto my predicament. I feel I'm at the stage where my ADHD has peaked. The brain fog is horrendous, I forget things, I zone out constantly. My symptoms have actually never been worse. Despite this, I recently received an offer from my university to go and do a short, intensive language course overseas for a month. This is a 6 hour day, 6 days a week kind of deal. I'm desperately worried that my worsening ADHD symptoms are going to prevent me from making the most of this opportunity.

How do I go about managing my symptoms while overseas, and especially while studying so intensively? I do not want to fly out of the country in a month and not remember anything, nor do I want to just coast by and do the bare minimum. How do I set my ADHD aside and fully grasp this?

Any and all advice is very very welcome. TIA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17tk0va/adhd_and_going_overseas/,True,2023-11-12 13:16:05,False,3,False,False,1,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/17tk0va/adhd_and_going_overseas/

I had no trouble finding my meds (ritalin 10mg) for a few months so I assumed it was ending, but this month apparently no Publix anywhere near me has any in stock. The person I talked to said that they're getting a warehouse shipment soon but don't know what will come in so I might as well try to find it elsewhere.

I find it really frustrating how difficult it is to get meds. I have to call around and find my meds, then I have to deal with rude pharmacists and go back and forth between my doctor and them. Then by the time my doc calls it in, it's out of stock again. I can't be certain then if I ask a pharmacy if they have it one morning that it'll be available that night. Pharmacies don't know what the shipment will bring so they can't tell me ahead of time if I'll get my meds or not. Insurance is being odd and won't cover meds every 30 days for some reason. I feel like no one listens to me because I'm just a patient and assumed to be drug seeking. My doc also wanted me to get 270 tablets for a 3 months supply but whenever I say I need that much on the phone, I always get some hesitation and ""Uhh...well...um..."" I feel very uncomfortable calling and asking for that amount.

I pay for a psychiatrist to manage my meds but I feel like I do everything. **How is she managing my medication if I can't find it and therefor can't take it at all?** I understand it's impossible for docs to call around for every patient, but couldn't they just call around for the patients on stimulants that can't find them? Pharmacists aren't even required to tell patients their stock so it feels like a waste of time. Ironically I can only get the courage to call around when I'm on meds, too.

He is currently in primary school, and I have noticed that he finds math easier compared to memorizing vocabulary (words and phrases), whether it's in his native language or a foreign language.

I believe this is because it involves repetition and lacks fun and accomplishment feeling when memorizing vocabulary.

2904,17tecod,t3_17tecod,Kind_Conversation895,How are motivational deficits related to ADHD exactly?,"I have been taking some low doses of methylphenidate, but after some reflection, I have come to realise that maybe 70% of my procrastination is really caused by negative emotions (like dread, loss of autonomy, and shame) and a lack of motivational salience (affective willingness or want).

When I think about the essence of ADHD, I think about cognitive impulsivity or disinhibition which makes it difficult to sustain attention. This impulsivity can cause emotional and motivational dysregulation as it might be hard to overcome impulsivity unless you are doing something highly stimulating, or it might be difficult to talk to yourself through your emotions. It could also lead to just never learning the skills to manage your motivation, or it could lead to bad experiences that condition those negative emotions.

However, to the extent that I am impulsive, I doubt that these are the pathways that have caused my negative emotions and my lack of motivational salience. Perhaps something like dopamine tolerance from technology use and need thwarting in school explains my situation better. However, I know that I have always lacked motivation relative to my peers and I am quite impulsive sometimes.

Aside from these pathways, is there a more direct explanation of how ADHD is linked to negative emotions and motivational salience? Might it be that motivational deficits are just part and parcel of ADHD together with impulsivity, as both of these are related to dopamine dysregulation? Part of this might also be a proneness to dopamine tolerance. Or does impulsivity specifically cause motivational deficits? Does it even make sense to differentiate the two possibilities?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17tecod/how_are_motivational_deficits_related_to_adhd/,True,2023-11-12 06:28:29,2023-11-12 06:33:28,2,False,False,1,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/17tecod/how_are_motivational_deficits_related_to_adhd/

I asked the doctor to give him the daytrana patch just to make things easier in the mornings and to see if it helps with the nausea.  After just 3 days of daytrana I've noticed positive change.  His mood/irritability self corrected almost over night.  It's been wonderful.   The only problem is cannot get the patch to stay on.  I've read the instructions.  I've read the website.  I've done everything that it's said to do.  The patch is terrible.  Almost as soon as I put it on him it  starts creasing and lifting.  Especially on the edges.   The website says that it's possible to swim and shower with this patch on but I don't see how that's even slightly true.   It seems like extremely poor quality adhesive.  Which is a huge disappointment because the medication is already showing to be an improvement in every other area.  I do not want to go back to Concerta and have his irritability and poor mood return.

Okay, so I‚Äôve always been quite aware of myself- have spotted bad behaviours in myself, have worked through some trauma issues, and have just generally been able to observe my brain kind of objectively. Simultaneously, I have always been quite confused about myself because I have behaviours that I‚Äôm not in control of, but don‚Äôt have the capacity to focus on understanding why I do certain things or to understand what I‚Äôm  thinking when I‚Äôm doing them. 

Since being medicated (I‚Äôm in my 4th month), I feel like I‚Äôm peeling back an onion. Like I can start to understand what happens when I lose control of what I do and what triggers that behaviour. 

It‚Äôs weird, because I thought the medication would stop me actually doing the things that I do (usually something reckless) as opposed to just making me aware that I want to do something (by being aware of them, I can start to de-escalate). Now, I can try and rationalise my feelings and think it through. 

This has confused me a bit, because is it the ADHD that makes me act recklessly or is it trauma? I grew up in a very DV household for a time and have experienced some very tough things that I have never really processed. 

I guess I‚Äôm wondering how deep the ADHD goes and what does medication do for adhd? Or has the medication treated everything well enough so that I can now view my behaviours as linked to trauma?

My younger brother who has Tourettes and ADHD has been constantly getting in trouble in school. His grades are alright in some classes, he can get the work done but he has trouble focusing and gets distracted.
The main issue though is that he lacks social awareness and says inappropriate things to other children and gets caught. He has been suspended twice for it. He claims that other students say stuff too or that he is just reacting to someone saying things to him. The issue is that he always gets caught. I am not sure what to do, we‚Äôve tried medication but adderall made his tourettes tics worse, and his tics are practically nonexistent without medication. 

I am just afraid he might get expelled, he is actually suspended currently because he took $50 from a students bookbag. When asked why he did it, he doesn‚Äôt really know.

Another thing, during our school meetings with him, they will tell us he is doing ok and just has issues with social settings but then randomly a week later he gets suspended for something that happened in the past. The stealing situation happened in the 30th of october, but he was suspended last Thursday for it (Nov 9th). I am not sure why the school did not tell us this happened during our meeting with them on the 2nd of november but they have done the same thing once before too.

It was amazing, I was also finally able to focus for as long as I wanted, even in school. Before, I was only able to focus for like 10 minutes in class before falling asleep, and with this information, I'm pretty sure you can guess how bad my grades are. My constant urge to play video games disappeared, I haven't felt tired once throughout the week even with 5 hours of sleep (I couldn't sleep because of the ADHD medicine side effects), and I'm finally able to complete my ambitions and goals. I haven't felt any of these feelings for almost the entirety of my life, feelings that I wish I've had without medication. As I made that thought, I started wondering, ""***Do taking ADHD pills make me feel the same way if I didn't have ADHD?***""  


I mean, I feel like this is a pretty reasonable question because ADHD pills completely (or mostly) reverses the effects of having ADHD. My 1st symptom was having a huge disinterest (or being extremely bored) in even the smallest things, the only things that could actually give me some interest are video games. Now that I took the ADHD pill, pretty much doing anything helps me have fun and anything can interest me, even school, which I thought would be impossible for me. Video games aren't as fun as truly learning now, which sounds corny but it somehow became true for me.  


Just like that, an ADHD medicine completely reversed one of my ADHD symptoms the same way it does to my many other ADHD symptoms. Because of that, I'm wondering if what I'm feeling right now with the pill is what I would feel if I never had ADHD (or close to).

I‚Äôm looking for some advice as we are fairly new to the adhd med game. My son is 9 and has been on Vyvanse for a year and a half. I got diagnosed around the same time, and while I needed to increase my dose once, I have been on the same dose for a year with no issues. 
We thought we had found the correct dose for my son, but then around January of last year we noticed he was dawdling a lot at bedtime, arguing more, and more unfocused at soccer in the evenings (his teacher had no issues in class). In February we decided alongside his doctor to increase his dose. He was making such fantastic strides, and we have had no issues (aside from the normal ones sprouting from sleep/food etc). About a month ago we noticed he started dawdling a lot, arguing a bit more, etc. I have been a little less on top of the protein heavy foods now that he‚Äôs back to school, and there have been a few weekends where he has had less sleep than normal, so we thought that may be the reason. Last week in the middle of the week he was goofing off in the bath, and got water everywhere. When he got out he slipped and fell and broke his front tooth on the bathtub. It was so traumatic for him, and myself, and now he needs to wait to see if he will need a root canal and a cap/,crown, or just a cap on its own. This incident is making me question if he could possibly use an increased dose, or if it truly was just a freak accident, and he‚Äôs just going through some 9 year old things. Now to land the plane on my question, how often do kids need their doses adjusted? Is it normal that while his dose has been perfect for him for 6 months now that he could all of a sudden need an increase again? Will we need to make sure we are on top of more frequent dose changes as he gets older?

So growing up Reading (specifically) Books they have never been my strong suit, not only is it really hard for me to focus enough to read what I'm seeing, but even if I manage to read parts, I struggle to understand what I'm reading it's kind of why I'm bad at English as a school subject,

Skipping to today,  I have to read a huge chunk of a book in my College English course to make a thesis about it, I was initially worried since I didn't know if I'd be able to read any at all. But I came up with an idea, 

Usually whenever I think or focus, on a thought I usually pace around in circles, I tried taking long paces around my house while Reading the book to see if it could help me get into my focus mode I usually do when walking and... It worked! 

From around atleast my first hour of reading I managed to get around 50-60 pages of the book and I'm actually amazed at how well it worked! Fast forward a second hour, and I zoom through another 30-40 pages, it might not be the biggest success on the forum, but It feels like such an accomplishment, like I just took down one of my greatest enemies since I was a kid, plus its also a good way to burn quick calories!

So this is actually something I have struggled with for years but never felt like I had the language to articulate to people why I struggle the way I do with video games.

Last year I got my diagnosis and it's recently just occurred to me that the issues I face with playing video games could be linked with the ADHD. 

My favourite types of game are large open-world style RPGs with lots to explore and collect and a good story. I get enjoyment out of collecting everything with use of a guide after completing the main story in a game. 

When a game (such as Spider-Man but this is true for most games I play) has a complex combat system, or has different upgrades etc to collect, I feel that my working memory really lets me down and I struggle to really get the most out of the game. This can make it frustrating to play at times and I just wondered if there are any techniques that people have used to help this? I considered using a journal to note fight combos etc as a sort of 'crutch' but I've never heard of anyone doing that.

Another thing is I will look forward to a game coming out for months (like TotK) and play it flat out for a few weeks and then drop it once I get overwhelmed or that initial rush is over. I find I get overwhelmed when a game is non-linear and the element of too much choice but on the other hand I love having so many options! I feel massive guilt over not playing for months and even tonight I played for a bit on my PS5 more out of guilt than anything else.

I know that a lot of this is something I should not feel guilty over but really the main advice I am looking for is how to tackle games with an ADHD brain.

4. Find something blue, followed by indigo.
5. Finally, try to find something violet.

Each time you successfully locate a color, give yourself one point. If violet is proving to be extremely rare or difficult to find, you can adjust the rules slightly.

My 3 year old just had his first parent teacher conference and I was holding back tears. All of the things that his teacher said he struggles with are the things I have truggled with all of my life. He is an amazing kid, loving, sweet, but extremely hyper active and talks endlessly. He‚Äôs my first child, so a lot of people give me the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs all boy‚Äù or ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a toddler, it‚Äôs normal‚Äù but I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs normal. We are social and interact with many other kids his age. 

He struggles with listening to anything. The second anyone tries to talk to him he immediately starts talking 100 miles a minute about whatever is on his mind. Attention span is non-existent. Breaks down over very small things like pulling up his underwear telling us he can‚Äôt while crying. This isn‚Äôt just here and there, it‚Äôs constant. We are very big on explaining and giving him choices, we try to re-direct calmly but also firm.  

Trying not to fixate on the thought of my kids growing up with ADHD but it crosses my mind a lot and this conference solidified that his behaviors are not just limited to home and his comfort zones.

This sounds stupid, and trust me, I've tried it and had it not work before, but hear me out;

My problem with getting up in the morning is usually with not getting enough sleep.  If I've had enough sleep, I don't spring out of bed, but I am able to stay awake in bed long enough to get bored and get up.

The problem?  I never go to bed on time.  I naturally sleep for around 8-9 hours, but I so frequently only get 5-6 that my body has started waking me up in the middle of the night after only 6 hours of sleep.  If I have enough time off, eventually I'll go back to 8-9.

Usually, the reason I get so little sleep is because I won't stop what I'm doing and just go get into bed.  I'll see the time at 7, think ""I should go to bed in a couple hours"" and then see the time again at like 11:00 and not know where the time goes.

My solution?  Buy an alarm clock to put next to my bed that goes off at 8:00 pm.  I might adjust the time depending on how things go, but the point is to get me to walk over to the bed, climb across it to turn off the alarm, and then lay down right there and go to sleep.

Wish me luck!  Hope this helps someone else <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17t2hn8/how_to_wake_up_in_the_morning/,True,2023-11-11 20:01:44,False,4,False,False,7,1.0,/r/ADHD/comments/17t2hn8/how_to_wake_up_in_the_morning/

It kicked in, and after about 3-4 hours I started to get blurry vision. Has this happened to anyone else? I read it‚Äôs a rare side effect- messaged my dr but the office is closed until Monday.

3003,17svdgi,t3_17svdgi,Mittens101,Doctor suggesting a different route?,"Diagnosed as an adult. Combined type and moderate severity. I also have ASD symptoms related to borderline personality disorder, generalized anxiety and depression. Yay /s

My doctor makes sense, he‚Äôs the one who identified that I need to stay the course on Bupropion. I‚Äôm on 150 SR. This was prior to diagnosis. 

His opinion isn‚Äôt anti adhd meds, however he did state that by this time (when not in childhood or early adolescence) most have created coping mechanisms. So he doesn‚Äôt go for stimulants as a first line. 

He said we can try increasing bupropion to 300, discontinue (wean off) current dose and start Strattera, and then we can consider Vyvanse or others. 

I tried 300xl bupropion and that was a big nope, nope fuck that after 2 weeks I knew something bad was happening and reverted to 150 dose and back to myself again. 

So now back to the drawing board, he is right I do have some coping mechanisms however this disorder has caused me so much pain (one of the causes of my anxiety and depression) and I need something to improve my executive function beyond the benefits of bupropion.

I fear I‚Äôll have 2 months minimum of adjustment with Strattera and no payoff in addition to losing the devil I know (bupropion). I have an essential job/career and a partner I love, I feel it‚Äôs risky to start with the *generally* least effective medication that takes the longest to adjust to. 

Am I overthinking it? Maybe I don‚Äôt know.

I‚Äôm in University - penultimate year of Bachelor‚Äôs and i‚Äôm in an exchange semester. Sometimes, things go fairly well, not gonna lie. But in recent times - I just showed over and over again how incredibly incapable I am in some aspects.

I have a fairy big Uni project and a few other courses. Today - I realized that I am struggling to prepare sufficiently in time for all of the exams and finish the project at the same time‚Ä¶ Yeah - I‚Äôm kinda panicking, but whatever, right? 

Furthermore, I‚Äôm constantly throwing out money by not being able to manage my schedule. I lost about 600$ due to just being an idiot.

But after moving the flights and the hotel stays, I realize that I cannot take the return flight because I have to be at home earlier that day - I book another flight. That one gets rescheduled by the airline, I try to cancel - they decline my refund, I try again and finally get my money back. Just to book a (now) even more expensive flight back home on that day.

That is however right in the preparation phase of my exams - so I will have to prepare for my exams abroad instead of explore the new country. Tiring. So today starting with exercises (because I couldnt be bothered to start during the semester) I talked to a friend about one of the final. 

Guess who booked another flight leaving the country 1 hour before this final‚Ä¶ Honestly, I do not care anymore at this point - I‚Äôll just take it as the other flights having been more expensive‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what to do and where to start.

I deep cleaned my room to lower allergens, I showered just before bed to feel better and lower my body temperature, I put on new pj's and limited blue light. 

And because I've been having issues taking my meds and getting up, I took a pill out of the bottle to put by my bed. I went to bed, and looked for pill. I couldn't see it so I checked downstairs. It occurred to me I only could dement taking it out of the bottle and then nothing. So I panicked, realising I'd ruined my chance at getting sleep. But I still wasn't sure and I was feeling tired so I lay down anyway. I felt some effects but I decided it was placebo. At half three I found myself wide awake and measuring my bike and accepted the reality. 

It's 11 now, I was extremely productive during the night and it really wasn't as bad as I worried. But I'm starting to get very drained and dissociated. I don't want to ruin my sleep schedule even further, but don't know if I can wait till tonight. 

I'm imagining having to explain the mistake to my housemates when they're up. It's pretty embarrassing. I always feel careless when I make a mistake with a med.

I have been going through a series of different intake evaluations, paperwork, and more to hopefully find a medication combination that will help me. I have bought and taken adderall from someone who was selling it to me, about a month ish ago, I was taking 45 mg daily (30 mg XR, then I would open another 30mg xr and eat about half the beads inside) The adderall had a HUGE impact on me. Geniuenly saved my life, helped me get my grades back on track as a freshman at university, gave me clarity, helped me focus way better, I was able to maintain a clean room, made bed, clean laundry, motivation and happiness with my life. Unfortunately, the person selling me the adderall isn't able to do so anymore and it has been almost 2 weeks since  I have taken my last adderall, all of my old habits have taken over again and it is incredibly hard for me to be happy, motivated, or do anything.   
How do I hold out until December 8th which is FINALLY my psych evaluation where I will get my first dose of medication. I am hoping for an anti depressant and adderall. After holding out until then, how do I manage to get the psychiatrist to prescribe me the adderall? My therapist has suggested for me to be honest with them and tell them it has produced huge benefits for me and improved my quality of life, but I am afraid that this will be seen as drug seeking behavior and I will not be prescribed it at all. Please let me know.  


TLDR: mental health issues all my life, been seeing a therapist for a while. Been going through psychiatrist process. Was taking adderall illegally for a while and it helped but plug stopped selling.

I contribute this to my adhd because it‚Äôs that weird internal frustration I feel that makes me feel trapped in my body. Also, even though I plan 30 min of a workout it‚Äôs near impossible for me to convince myself that it won‚Äôt take all day.
